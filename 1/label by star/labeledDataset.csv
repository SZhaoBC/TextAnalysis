negtive,2,Samsung threw a curve with the standard Galaxy S7| Like the S6 the S7 looks flat| but unlike the S6 the S7 screen has is a slight curve down on the edges| Zagg has established a great reputation for producing some of the best screen protectors out there| This is why I purchased the Zagg Invisible Shield Glass| which says on the box it is for the Galaxy S7 (not Edge)| but it will not fit properly| Because of the slight curve of the S7 screen at the edges| the Glass screen protector cannot adhere to the edge leaving a halo effect about one eighth of an inch around the edges| From my research| I found this issue has been documented on the web since last spring| Zagg no longer offers this screen protector for the S7 on their website| yet they never recalled the millions of units still out there| nor have they informed the retailers this item will not fit the S7 according to my Best Buy Associate| Zagg now offers the Glass Curve for the S7| which Best Buy does not offer at this time| However| the screen protector only comes in BLACK| The screen portion is clear with black opaque top and bottom that will cover the color portion of the phone| Now if you have a standard black phone| not a major issue| If you have a colored phone| the color of the phone is covered and you now have a black phone| Also| many have complained that the new Glass Curve makes the touch screen less sensitive requiring multiple swipes and harder pressure| Others have complained the edge of the Glass Curve shield will eventually lift from the screen|There are pros and cons to using a screen protector with today's Gorilla Glass 4| As far as film type protectors| I don't think they are necessary for today's screens| as they reduce the quality of the screen touch and view| and offer no real protection for screen breakage| As for the Glass type protectors| I do believe they offer protection for screen breakage while keeping the touch and view qualities of the screen|| In fairness to BB and Zagg| BB offered to return/refund and Zagg offered to replace with the new Curve Glass when available| I bought my Zagg as part of an accessory bundle and if refunded| I lose my discount on the other items in the bundle| I do not want a BLACK screen protector and it is unknown if Zagg will produce a clear version of the Glass Curve| The Invisible Shield Glass I have now functions| feels right to the touch| does not diminish the sensitivity of the screen| and the halo on the edge is only noticeable when the screen has a dark image or is off| I would only recommend this screen protector for the S7 if you can get it at an extreme discount as it will still protect| I highly recommend the Invisible Shield Glass for any device it actually fits|
negtive,1,Bought both the s7 and the Zagg InvisiSheild Glass| Actually| I bought two of the Zagg products| but| not because I wanted to| Let me explain||| I bought the phone and screen protector| though the screen protector was at a different store| It was close by| so i paid for it and picked it up| I came home and attempted to install using the easy install tabs| First| when I followed the instructions| and executed Step 2 - Remove protective film at 1 icon| the actual screen protector oil-resistant nano coating and scratch resistant tempered glass layer had separated from the Premium screen protection layer and the adhesive| I didn't realize this| because the screen protector and the protective film were indistinguishable from each other)| After several attempts of installing the protectors glass adhesive layer (not realizing the protector was already destroyed and useless because the main protection layer was not attached to the Glass and adhesive layers)| I kept noticing the edges wouldn't lay down| In attempting to seal them| I (like several other reviewers) ended up creating bubles in the main viewing area| In the process of trying to correct that| I ripped the adhesive layer and had no screen protection| I went back to Best Buy thinking it was all my fault (when in fact| even if it had laid down good| the product was defective in the box)| I bought a 2nd screen protector and this time I paid BestBuy to do it| It's on| but| it doesn't look like it is| You can see a gap between the s7's beveled edge| and the flat screen protector| My phone and screen protector are less than two days old| and because of the edges of the protector not clinging to the edge of the device| There are tons of dust and other stuff clinging to that edge of exposed adhesive| and| with part of the screen edge exposed| does the screen protector actually provide the level of protection it is intended to? Absolutely not| This was a bad release| period| It feels like they took one of the other protectors for a flat phone and branded it for the s7 to avoid not having a product when the phone released| while they try and fix it with a "curved glass" s7 model| I'm really hoping that Zagg will honor their Guarantee| and fix this problem for me| I have purchased Zagg protection for every device I have (Tab s| 2x s5| s7| 2x Nooks| etc)| In every situation with the exception of the Galaxy s7| I was thrilled with how the other Zagg products performed| ease of installation| and overall quality| I installed them easily and without any bubbles on my 10" Tab S| 9" Nooks| and my s5's| This s7 protector is not good|
negtive,1,I used to go commando| no screen protection and no case|||until I dropped my (fortunately very inexpensive and old Motorola) phone 2ft onto the street as I was getting out of my car| I can't tell you how many times I've done that| but this was the last drop| The screen was completely destroyed| Lucky me| I was due for an upgrade| Ultimately I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S7 (normal style| not the Edge)| For outer protection| I picked up a TECH21 EVO Check case| for which I did read reviews|||lots and lots of reviews| and it's perfect| For the screen I bought this Zagg Glass Screen Protector|||without reading reviews| Even as I type this| I still haven't read what others are saying about it| Instead I went on the recommendation from the Best Buy Employee| At home| excited to play with my new toy| I applied the glass screen to my new phone| I didn't have much trouble aligning it| and the yellow "peel this side off first|||don't touch the adhesive side" message was as clear and concise as could be| Then came the disappointment|||the S7 has a slight curve to it and the glass shield did not lay flat on the left and right edges| I could immediately see the potential for lint| dust| and funk to collect under this 1/8" lip on both sides| I thought I installed it wrong| So I got online| registered my shield| and then called Zagg for installation support| After looking me up in their system and hearing my complaint| the Zagg employee was quick to admit that this was a known problem| She confirmed that I had in fact correctly installed the shield| and then informed me that they have developed a shield to match my phone| She further explained that Zagg had not yet pulled all units back from the sales floors and that they will replace my purchase for free| After collecting/confirming my info she waived the shipping and mailed me (via USPS) the correct Glass Curve Shield (model: GS7CGC-BK0)| While there was no additional money out of my pocket| the replacement took 29 days to arrive| I couldn't find my replacement here on Best Buy's website| I have a feeling that Zagg still hasn't formally released it| Here's my 4-star review for that|||Patience| a steady hand| perfect vision| and a dust free environment is HIGHLY recommended for installation| The Glass Curve Invisible Shield for the Samsung Galaxy S7 fits perfectly on all edges| The border/trim has a black finish that helps to hide the fact that you have a screen protector at all| which I love! However| the symbols for the Home button and the Back button (the white back-lit capacitive buttons on the bottom left and right of the phone) are covered by the glass shield and its black finish| Etched through the black are the exact shapes for said buttons| Any error in placement of the glass shield will cover-up and/or block the backlight from these buttons| Applying this shield made me feel like the nervous bomb squad guy trying to cut the correct wire| Steady| Focus| Easy now| Easy| As if worrying that I hadn't cleared the screen of finger prints and dust wasn't enough| I was in a panic about correctly aligning the shield| There's probably a way to do it| but I couldn't figure out how to keep the Home and Back buttons on so I could see the light as I aligned the shield| And so| I did have to lift it back up once to correctly fit| Zagg should have instructions to do the following|||After cleaning and prepping to install the shield| hold the bottom edge against the phone and align the Home and Back buttons then slowly lower the glass over the speaker and camera at the top|All said and done| I really like the end results| This screen protector blends in perfectly with the TECH21 EVO case (Smokie/Black)| The finished look merits 5 stars| but perfection is required for the install to phone and not everyone has dexterity +100| For that I'd give it 3 stars| However| Zagg was friendly and compliant about the replacement so I'm averaging that out to 4-Stars|Good Luck!
negtive,1,I made the big mistake of not reading the reviews for this before I bought it| I've purchased Zagg products before and have always been happy|||especially with their screen protectors| I never purchased the glass protector before| but figured I would this time around since I now have to worry about my phone with a new child| Since Zagg has always been so great| I didn't bother reading the reviews| Boy| was that a mistake| Had a read the reviews ahead of time| I would have not purchased the glass protector| I purchased the S7 (not the S7 edge)| but what some people don't realize (people who are claiming that the review writers bought the S7 protector for the S7 edge) is that there is a slight curve to the screen on the edges| It's very subtle| but it is there and I didn't even realize it until I put the glass protector on and it didn't sit flat at the edges| I kept trying to push it down thinking I just didn't apply enough pressure at the edges| but if you squeeze down harder on the edges itself| then a bubble starts to form towards the middle| As it's the glass| it can't bend to fit securely on the screen| so once I put pressure on the edge| it was forces to keep it's form and come up in other places to achieve that state| My photos show where the protector didn't seal against the screen along the edge|||where it's sealed| it's black and where it's gray is where it's not sealed| I am very disappointed with Zagg on this product because had they actually tested this on a unit| they would have realized it wouldn't work and not sell it| Seems like the just got the measurements of the phone and just created the screen protector for it| I'm going to return this to Best Buy and purchased the HD screen protector||||of course after reading the reviews| I see that Zagg is going to come out with a curved glass protector for both the new S7 phones| but until then| I will need something to protect the screen|
negtive,3,The Zagg glass covering my (regular) Samsung S7 is terrific - with one major drawback| It seems that even my "regular" S7 has a slight curve in the screen on the long edges| Therefore the last 1/8" or so of the sides of the Zagg glass cover are not really touching the screen| If you don;t have a case| or if your case doesn't have tall enough sides to protect the screen| you will find yourself touching those areas| and inevitably making finger-edge-shaped breaks in the glass| This cannot be helped - the glass is hanging there| off the screen| These breaks only extend as far as the raised part of the cover (where it does not touch the screen)| but REALLY NOW||| This is not what I paid a premium price for| I would have thought this issue would have played into the design of the cover| I fear that ZAGG will be replacing this cover more than once over the phone's lifetime!
negtive,2,Not the best fit around the edges as others have stated| The S7 (non edge version) does have a slight bend around the edge of the glass| So the zaag glass screen protector does not fit well on the outside edge| It looks like you didn't press the screen protector down or have an air bubble on the Edge| but you don't| The screen protector is constantly lifted just a little off the screen| With a case on you don't notice it as much but if you try to drag icons to the Edge or use the edge of your phone it doesn't work until you press VERY hard| I purchased the non edge screen protector for the Non edge s7 and it just doesn't live up to the zaaz quality you expect| I gave it 1 star as it does protect the screen from damage but makes it hard to use| The 2nd star is because of the added "bonus" of collecting all the lint in my pocket| 2 photos are of the issue| pen is not lifting the screen protector just showing where the Edge is and the lifted edge| Case on the phone is the Spigen® [Ultra Hybrid] AIR CUSHION [Crystal Clear]
negtive,1,Even after being assured by Best Buy rep (who was great BTW & did look at these reviews with me) that this thing would fit| it doesn't| Not even a week later & dust/dirt under both sides| Contacted Zagg||| who is now putting one out that DOES cover the edges| Zaggs reply was that this is SUPPOSED to fit like this| That this protector is supposed to have a halo effect on around the edges and that all of their products have a lift| Huh?? So then why not advertise this as such due to the S7 design & inform your biggest retailer that the sides will NOT lay flat?? $700 phone||| I don't want some misfit piece of junk covering the screen| And unfortunately| this is all Best Buy has to offer if you want to leave the store with a protector on| Zagg is indeed putting out a new one that promises to cover the sides of both S7 and S7 Edge| I guess thats a coincidence? And they are NOT going to exchange these defects (that they claim are not defective)| They are offering an exchange for the exact same product| So by that offer| and their joke offer of free shipping||| we should be exchanging these weekly then? Major fail on Zagg| Major fail for not letting Best Buy reps know this product is "supposed" to not lay flat| And major fail for not being willing to exchange them| Stay far away from this mess| Unless you want to be $48 out| $39|99 plus installation| You work too hard for your money||| don't throw it away|
negtive,1,I have always used| recommended| and even sold Zagg screen protectors (as a wireless professional) but I must admit| these S7 "Invisible Shield Glass" suck!!! Thinking it was an issue with the installation or possibly a defective product I emailed Zagg & they sent me a replacement| waived shipping costs| and didn't require that I sent them the original "shield" back| Well after a week and a half I got the new one & (after I powered it off and let it sit for 5-10 mins) I obsessively cleaned my brand new S7| installed the new "shield" and let it sit overnight| The next morning I awoke to find the same "halo" or ring around my screen where the adhesive didn't stick| I emailed Zagg 3 times more asking if I paid the difference and upgraded to the "Curved Glass Shield" would it remedy my issue|||| 10 days later and well outside my orig| 30 i'm still awaiting an answer| Is this really what they provide a customer for $44|99?!? I put my otterbox on it and left it on untill I find a company who makes something suitable| You made me sad Zagg|||| Not cool @ all!
positive,5,I have used Zagg screen protectors for all my devices| and if I need to replace my crack screen protector| not a problem when I can just pay $5 for a replacement| I believe that this is best screen protector on the market today| The great thing about this protector and not just this protector from Zagg but all their screen protectors have a lifetime warranty| After your purchase the screen protector the first thing you do is go to the Zagg website and register the screen protector| because If your screen protector has happens to crack| instead of having to buy a new one| just login into the Zagg website| and order a replacement screen for only $5 which covers shipping or shipping is free I don't remember| They will send you a screen protector| once you received in the mail go to best buy have them remove the old screen protector| and put on the new screen protector| Then you send old screen protector back to Zagg using the yellow envelope that they sent you in the mail| Though| you spend a lot of money for the best screen protector on the market| and if it cracks| order a replacement for $5| and send in the old one| without having to buy a new one each time| I recommend getting the Glass screen protector| NOT the Plastic version| I will say for the S7 screen protectors that there a some batches of the product out there that have not worked out the issue with fully protecting the screen with the short curve it has| I still does the job because I have a case on my S7| you hardly notice it|
negtive,2,Let me say that I love Samsung and the Galaxy phones as well as Zagg| in the past I have had nothing but great experiences with both products and companies| However| the new phones| specifically the Galaxy S7| has a beveled edge to the screen| This means that the screen protector will NOT lay flat all the way to the edge| The original salesperson gave me the line that the screen protector would "blend" to the edges over time| It has been months and the edges are still off the glass| And let me be clear| the staff at Best Buy installed this product| I have kept the screen protector on| but this means that dirt gathers under the lip and it suffers from small frays and cracks| I have no idea what Zagg would say if the glass broke| probably something about it being my fault since the screen protector was frayed| But it still provides protection for the phone| I am just hoping that with all of the engineering minds at both companies| they will come out with a screen protector that lays flat| But as I am writing this| the salesperson I recently spoke with says that it doesn't exist|
negtive,3,I had Zagg glass piece on my S5 and then I threw my phone out of anger and it shattered the Zagg glass but kept my S5 screen intact| I called Zagg n they sent me a replacement glass for my S5| So when I bought the S7 I decided to pay the $8 for the Best Buy employee to put it on| The girl ruined the first one| then the second attempt had a crack in it so it wouldn't seal right| and the third time a piece of lint was trapped| The fourth time was the charm| or so I thought| The edges look like they are still not sealed (kind of looks like small bubbles) and i keep trying to press it down and they disappear and come right back| Its been over a month and I just haven't had time to go back to Best Buy| Its noticeable but not enough for me to go up there| Well last week i was pushing on the edges as i often do and now its got a small crack that looks like how a window looks when a bullet goes through it| There is also a chip on the edge that curves around the home button| Now I'm not happy especially since this was a $40 piece of glass| I've never had issues with Zagg glass until this one for my S7| It just seems like the quality isn't as good| I hope they can replace it at store when I go this week| Im going to give this one more try because I've always considered these Zagg glass pieces to be a good investment to protect my phones expensive screen|
negtive,1,I had a different brand screen protector from verizon store for 2 years on my HTC One M8 and it worked great| I upgrade to the S7 and got the zagg screen prootector and it doesn't respond to my touch on one side of the screen unless i press down harder than normal| Also| if i run my finger along the side it wont start to recognize my touch until about a third of the way up the screen| I tried returning it to Best Buy within 15 days and they refused to return or exchange it and instead directed me to the manufacturers website| 3 weeks after purchase the screen chipped on the side and started to crack even though i never even dropped the phone or treated it roughly| Apparently now i have to spend additonal funds for shipping to replace this "fine" product when it is a lifetime warranty| Puts a bad taste in the mouth because of Best Buy's return policy| or should i say lack there of| To top it off there is nothing on the receipt that explains their return policy| Better yet| the cell phone rep installs it immediately on the phone when its purchased which immediately cancels any chance of returning if you changed your mind|
negtive,2,When I originally bought this product it was $40| Immediately after putting it on| the screen protector did not adhere to my phone on the outside edges at all| I have a regular Samsung Galaxy s7 (not s7 edge) and I made sure to buy the right screen protector| But when I put it on my phone| there is at least a centimeter or two on the entire outside edge that is lifted up and will not stick to the phone| My friend had the same problem| and even after ordering a replacement| the replacement had the same exact issue as well| Before ordering the replacement I had the original for two months and let me tell you| there were cracks EVERYWHERE| It would crack at the lightest drop/ bump/ scratch| anything| Honestly it cracked much easier than the phone itself ever would and while that should be a good thing| it was just annoying| Because the entire outer edge is lifted| it's super easy so get water or dust particles stuck underneath the screen protector| Overall this purchase was a mistake| Just stay with regular screen protectors-not the glass ones| They'll save you a lot of money and frustration|
negtive,3,Bought this screen protector for my Galaxy S7 and was not impressed with how it looked on my phone| It did fit onto my screen but all around the edge of it| it looks like it is lifted and has bubbles| I got it put on at Best Buy and the employee who did it told me they all look that way due to the curves around the entire phone| It drives me a little crazy but now I just ignore it| I needed it more for protection for my screen| I can say that it does have a year guarantee with Zagg if you register it and if something happens to it you pay a small replacement fee and they'll send you a new one| Unfortunately| I cracked this screen protector within a few days because I accidentally dropped it onto a cement floor| It did save my actual screen though| That's what happens when you carry to many things at once| Cracked the screen protector the first time it fell and still haven't replaced it yet| I am going to once I stop procrastinating| Personally I don't think it's worth the $40 because I was unhappy with the way it looked on my phone and unhappy that it broke the first time it fell| It did save my actual screen| so I still gave it 3 stars!
positive,4,I wanted to clear up the complaints about the edge of the screen protector having a haze or not making complete contact| It is true| however; there is more to the story| First| the reason this is occurring is the new S7 design has a rounded corner along the edge| (not the S7 Edge| the regular S7)| This softens the edge| Zagg failed to take this into account when they release the screen protector| One option would have been to slightly shrink the size to match the flat surface and not extend over the curved portion of the screen| That is the reason you have poor or no contact around the edge| Is this important? With your screen off (black) you can see it| When the screen is on you can not see it| Also| if you have something like an Otter skin or Tech21 protector on your phone it hides it even more| It is aggravating Zagg did not account for this but the safety and protection delivered by this glass screen protector is superior to anything else I have seen| I had one on my S6 for the last year and it looks like the day I bought| it| Don't let the complaints about the edge discourage you| Maybe Zagg will react quickly and release and updated version that addresses this|
negtive,1,Someone at the store recommended this screen protector| after it was installed I noticed it doesn't actually fit on the screen| The Galaxy S7 (not the edge) still has a slight curvature on the sides| That curvature means the glass doesn't fit flush and dust and dirt can and will get stuck under the screen| You also end up looking at a piece of glass that is clearly not attached to the screen| The gap between screen and glass around the edges also makes it hard to press buttons around the edge| I would not recommend this unless they fix the gapping issue| As it stands I'm curious when the dust and dirt build up under the edges is going to drive me crazy and force me to go with a different protector| In the attached picture you can see the gap around the edges|
negtive,1,There are those people who needed a screen protector because they will drop their phone| guaranteed| I however am not one of those people| I haven't used| Screen protector in years because other than usual wear and tear| my screens typically look pretty dang good by the time I get a new phone| For some reason they convinced me this time| I got the case| They installed it| Looked perfect| I was pretty pleased|||until 6 days later it chipped and was dropping teeny tiny pieces of glass everywhere| Then less than 24 hours later| a large chunk of the corner chipped and made a crack| So I took it back and they replaced it for free bc of the short time| They gave me specific instructions for care the first 48 hours (which they failed to include the first| so I figured this time would be different|) I followed the instructions really well| It was a weekend so I barely even touched my phone| And here I am 6 days later| (2 of those days the phone was unused) and I have a chip| a decent sized chip| When I pay $40 for a screen protector it is expected to last| Extremely disappointed in the product| will never use it again|
negtive,2,I bought two phones at Best Buy and had the protecters installed on both phones | My phone is ok| But my wife's is lifting around the edges| Same phones same protectors| She went back to Best Buy to see if they could fix the problem| Their response was go to Zagg website and register it or I'll sell you a new one that fits the S-7 properly| Or Zagg will send you a new one for a cost of $5|00| They wouldn't make good on it because she went back after 14 days| We purchased the items May 14th 2016| She went in on June 27 th because we had been out of town| We were not aware of the Zagg warranty because they Best Buy employees threw away the screenprotector and phone case packaging away| After they put the protector and case on| The principal of the matter is if they put the wrong protector on whey should we have to pay the 5: dollars for the replacement or pay for a new one| I feel it is their response ability to put the right products on your devices in the first place| Still haven't registered it yet| Because of the principal behind the matter| I have had this brand of protector on past phones with no issues what so ever| I
positive,5,I gave 5 stars because the product itself is great in my opinion| I love zagg glass screen protectors but this one is not the right fit for the Galaxy S7 due to the slight curve on the sides of the phone| The shield stays uplifted on the sides which caused the shield to crack on the bottom right edge of the screen protector being that it does not lay flat on the phone screen| It was installed at Best Buy at the time of purchase| I will definitely continue to buy zagg glass screen protectors again for my other products but not for this phone unless the protector is slightly curved like the phone| I would recommend this product but not for this phone|
positive,4,Having recent moved from a Blackberry Z10 to the Samsung S7| I needed some sort of screen protector for the S7| From talking with others it was a toss up between the Zagg Glass or HD screen protector| I went with the glass screen protector as the conversion always seemed to come back to it is better to break the glass on the screen protector than the actual screen| Well as the S7 does not have a protected edge and I initially was using my S7 without a case and storing the S7 in my belt clip holster| after a few slides across my car seats and down between the car seat rail and the floor| the edges of the glass screen protector did exactly what they were suppose to do| they chipped on the egdes| Of course in an area where your fingers are normally when you are holding the phone| For now I have added an OtterBox Commuter case to the phone and nave stopped using my holster| This keeps my fingers from picking up little glass fragments however it means that my phone is in my back pocket| on my desk or sitting on the table| I will be replacing the glass InvisibleShield with an HD InvisibleShield soon|
negtive,3,Zagg should have been prepared to deal with the S7's screen edges| I am pretty disappointed in how the left and right edges of the screen protector are not in contact with the screen| This causes the 'p' and other far left or right items to be a pain to register| In writing this is had to tap multiple times on the 'p' to get it to register| It requires more of a 'press' than a tap| I've heard rumors that Zagg is fixing this issue in the next few months| The raised edges have also presented a weak point in the strength of the screen protector| The top and bottom corners in one side began to crack even though I have my phone in an otterbox slim|In the end however| I would still recommend as currently there is not much better of an option and Zagg is supposed to fix it soon| I'm expecting an unconditional swap once the new ones are available| Note to Zagg: you should pay for the Geek Squad installation as I've already paid and continue to deal with issues from your product|
negtive,1,This is one of the worst products I've ever purchased| I had T-Mobile put it on since best buy charges a fee to apply it (lame)| The guy who put it on said he didn't care for these particular ones and when I asked why his reply was "oh you will find out soon enough" well low n behold I did| The edges of the screen protector wouldn't completely adhere to the phone screen| It was like a bubble or something all the way around on the edges of it and within approximately 6-8 hours later there was already a couple cracks on the edges| By the next day there was quite a few more| I have only had it on my phone for a week and it looks like it's been on for 6 months| Needless to say it was a waste of $40| Doesn't really matter to me that it's a lifetime warranty cause it's pointless since I would have to send it in for a new one every other day| I would give it 0 stars if I could
negtive,3,If you can get it on the phone right and I mean if this is an excellent screen protector| The nicest thing about it is it is actually made of glass so you preserve the feel of the face of the phone and it's very friendly to the touch| The downside is you have to be extremely careful putting it on you pretty much have one chance| If you get a single Speck of dust under this thing or if it goes on slightly crooked or anything like that| you're going to have a bubble and it's going to drive you insane until you buy the next one| They do have a warranty and they better for 50 bucks| You have to send it in to get the exchange though| I much prefer the store brand if it's available I bought this one that particular day because they were out of stock| The store brand screen protector which I believe is by Insignia|| it has plenty of cleaning materials| and also it has a plastic guide to Aid in installation I've done two of them on my other phone and they work perfectly every time and they're half the price
negtive,2,I wanted a tempered glass shield for my to-be-shipped S7 & this was the only S7 screen shield my local store had|When my S7 arrived| I applied this shield| My S7 was brand spanking new| But the bottom part of this shield didn't stick|I was passing by a Best Buy Mobile store & figured they would have more choices (wrong)| and stopped in (they were closing early| what the heck?) and the people there said they wouldn't exchange the shield because it had been more than 15 days|| I think they just wanted to go home| Gee whiz| I couldn't apply the shield until the new S7 arrived in the mail!!!!!!So I made a special trip back to the same Best Buy where I bought the shield and exchanged it for a new one| I'll try reapplying it soon| Hope it works|I did not have this much trouble with a generic tempered glass shield I bought from e bay for my S5|Very disappointed that all the Best Buy stores don't treat customers the same way|
positive,5,I don't know why people hate this so much| It's probably because they didn't have the Best Buy guy put this on for them| If it's done properly| this stuff is great| I've put this on several of my phones and have it for my parent's phones and it's good stuff| In case you are clumsy and drop your phone| at least this will crack first not your glass on your phone| You can spend $35 on this stuff or pay $100 to replace the glass on your phone and hope it works the same| It will make your phone a bit heavier too but it will keep your phone safe| especially if you have kids who break their phones all the time| Plus it helps keep your phone cleaner too| it's easy to clean and keeps your phone germ free| Have the Best Buy people put this on for you| they are the experts and will make sure it's done right| Don't do it yourself| that's why you guys all hate it and think it sucks| And you gotta let it chill for a day or two| you can't picking at it or messing with it right away|
negtive,2,The issue of this screen protector not fitting the Galaxy S7 has been well documented in reviews so I will not reiterate the issue| Zagg messed up on this one and should have recalled this product long ago| especially for the price| Zagg's website no longer list this product for the S7 as they now have a curved Glass protector for the S7 and S7 Edge| I called Zagg and they will replace this screen protector for the new curved one| but there is currently one issue with the new one| The new curved Glass protector only comes in opaque black| The screen is obviously clear| but the portion that covers the color portion of the face is opaque| so your gold| platinum| or other color phone is covered and will have a black face| FYI| BB does not carry the new curved Zagg product| To be fair the old product will work and protect your screen| if you do not mind the halo effect| Zagg should lower the price of this product considerably to compensate!
positive,5,This screen protector isn't perfect| but it really isn't the fault of the protector| Samsung's decision to slightly curve the sides of the S7's screen makes finding a good glass screen protector difficult| I've owned 2 protectors that seal to the screen fully| BUT they didn't cover the whole viewing screen and left annoying edges on the on the touch screen| The Zagg protector covers the entire viewing screen| but does not seal to it completely because of the curves| The edges of the screen are responsive| more protected| and I don't notice the edges not being fully sealed| It also fits well with a Speck case| or an Otter Defender|Zagg does now make a curved protector| but it is considerably more expensive| and some reviewers say it is tough to put a case on with the curved protector installed| As long as I own an S7| this Zagg is my choice!
positive,4,I purchased this glass screen protector knowing full well what the reviews were on it| But I felt I did not have a choice as you never know what will happen to your phone| Overall it does the job| but there are 2 significant issues you should be aware of that are frustrating at times but in my opinion should not prevent you from buying the product| Issue 1 is that you WILL get a halo effect around the edge of the display as the Galaxy S7's screen is slightly curved| Along with this halo effect the screen protector can get a little dirty around the edge but it has been very minor for me| The second issue and maybe the bigger problem of the 2| is that the touch screen sensitivity is made less in certain areas which can drive you crazy at times| Sliding down notifications from the top or pressing any button around the edge typically requires y a harder press| This being said it is probably still the best option for protecting your S7|
negtive,1,This screen protector has a great feel and does an awesome job at resisting oil/smudges| The only problem is that it does not fit the slightly beveled edge of the Galaxy S7 (non-Edge)| The result is a "halo effect" (a quick online search will show this is a universal problem due to a design flaw) around the edge of the phone which attracts dirt and lint under it almost immediately| I would recommend finding a more temporary (perhaps non-glass) version until Zagg updates their design to accommodate the edges of this phone|And remember| Best Buy (at least in Woodbridge| VA) will charge you about $8 to install one of these screen protectors (even if you purchase the brand new phone from them| complain about the fitment of the protector before you leave| and get told to "just bring it back and we'll replace it if the fit doesn't resolve itself after a couple days")|
negtive,3,I purchased the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and like all my other smart phones i have had i want screen protection| I purchased the Zagg Glass Screen Protector because of Zaggs quality and reputation| I had Best Buy install this on my phone cause i am not to good at this sort of thing| He warned me that with this Glass Screen Protector there was going to be a Halo around the edge of the screen cause the Samsung Galaxy S7 screen is curved at the edge| I thought this was ok| What i did not anticipate was under the glass where the halo is its a dust magnet| Pocket lint and dust gets under the glass and looks bad| I am unsure what to do about it cause i still want screen protection but the dust under the halo is so annoying| I hope zagg comes out with a new and improved product cause i will probably just take this off soon and go with out| Also this screen protector is EXPENSIVE| not worth the price when it has a halo that collects dirt|
negtive,1,My husband and I both purchased these for our new Samsung S7 phones (not edge)| Mine cracked in the corner just being in my purse| I believe something got underneath the edge that doesn't stick to the screen and caused the crack| My husband dropped his phone and all around the edges was cracked| We ordered warranty replacements and Zagg only sent us plastic protectors| not the glass| When I asked about this obvious problem with the glass the rep said they are aware of the problem and are waiting for a new design to become available| We're still waiting| In the meantime Zagg is harassing me to send back my broken glass screen protector or they are going to charge me full retail for the replacements they sent us| I don't have a lot of trust in this company's design or warranty process| These certainly were no where near worth the money spent or all the hype|
negtive,2,Center of screen area is great and seems to proctect well from scratches etc| however with the slightly contoured edges of the s7 the flat screen protector leaves a ring around the outside of the phone screen where it is not actually attached to the screen| this gap allows for dust and the like to get under the screen protector edges which I find frustrating as I try to keep my phone screen clean| I have had it on my phone for about two weeks (I am gentle with my phone in daily use) and there are already two cracks in the screen protector| only at the edges where the screen protector does not actually seal to the phone| while it's understandable that free floating glass would be fragile| it is still annoying to see every day on my phone| and I think if the screen protector actually sealed to the screen all the way around this probably would not have happened|
positive,5,I purchased this screen protector for my Galaxy S7 because I was very happy with the one I had on my Galaxy Note 4|I love the fact that the glass shield actually feels like the phone itself| and yet offers excellent protection at the same time|I've only been using this protector for 3 months (luckily| no drops to test its capabilities)| but I have no doubts that this will work as well as the one I had for the Note 4|Zagg is very easy to work with| both registering the product| and getting a replacement when needed|Of special note (to me| anyways) | | | I had to replace my phone within a week of purchasing it (and| putting on the Zagg Shield) | | | and I was able to remove the shield and reapply it to the new phone without a hitch|This is| easily| the best investment for protecting my phone that I could have|
negtive,1,I've owned other Zagg Glass screen protectors that have worked out very well but this one seems to be lesser quality| The shield doesn't cover the phone all the way to its edges| The edges don't adhere because of the slightly curved phone edges| Within two days of application the screen protector was already cracked in the corner| Ordered a warranty replacement and within a few days of application of that one there was a big scratch across the face of it| I keep the phone in my purse and have never had issues with other Zagg products| I've had this phone for about a month and already had two screen protectors replaced| Ordering warranty replacements add up when you have to keep paying for shipping|
negtive,1,Have use Zagg products in the past for different phones|The S7 (NON EDGE Model) still has a very slight curve on the sides of the display|The glass protector is flat| and therefore leaves the smallest of gaps around the edges of the phone|This gap will cause the protective layer to crack ||| as I experienced when I dropped the phone| and the glass protector cracked at the bottom right (exactly where the gap between the protection layer and screen exist)| Supposedly Zagg recognizes this gap and is updating the product to fit flush in future product releases|I've removed the cracked screen protector completely and have gone with the Lifeproof FRE case| Save yourself $40 and find a solid case| or a correctly formed screen protector|
negtive,3,Purchased this because I was told it was the best screen protector| Paid the tech at the store to put it on and within 4 days it lifted from the corner| Was told I had to contact Zagg to get a replacement and will then have to pay again to have it placed on the phone| My hand shakes so it's not best for me to do it| Inconvenient for sure| I have to answer whether or not I would recommend this and can only pick yes or no| My answer is truthfully| I don't know -- that option is not available| And I haven't dropped the phone (thankfully)| If I do before the replacement arrives and my screen cracks| I will be extremely unhappy|
positive,4,We've used Zagg shields in the past and loved them| Had them on our (wife and I) S5s and they saved us once each| And easy replacement from Zagg (customer service is without reproach)| This particular shield isn't perfect though| Right at the edge of the screen it doesn't stay stuck down| The S7 has a slight fall off near the edge that isn't flat| You can see the shield doesn't make contact around that border and requires a little harder tap if there's something right near the edge of the screen| It's about 1/8" on either side|I still think this is probably the best product on the market for the phone| The soft shields are horrible| Even the Zagg soft one comes too close to the edges (it was an exact perfect fit) and precludes the use of a cover that comes up over the edge|
negtive,1,This is just a patch that ZAGG released early as a way to get people to buy a screen protector they know doesn't fit| ZAGG support says a contoured one will release beginning of April so wait until then to get one| Best Buy should put out a notice in the meantime that you are purchasing a faulty product| Should just buy a case with a screen shield until then unless you don't mind dust collectors and scratching yourself on the screen protector|
negtive,2,Zagg just announced that the curved version of this protector is now available| I recommend purchasing that protector instead|Yes| even the non-Edge version of the S7 has a slight curve at the L & R edges| And since this protector is flat| it separates from the screen at the edges| The Best Buy associate used the euphemism of it being a "halo" effect| but did not tell me about this "feature" until after I purchased it and had them install it| If it were only cosmetic| it would not bother me that much| However| realize that where the protector does not touch the screen| the touch screen will obviously be inoperative| So things like dragging icons from one home screen to the next is difficult unless you press down hard when doing so|
negtive,3,My wife and I recently bought Galaxy S7 phones| We bought the Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector at the same time and had them installed in the store| Zagg produced an original glass screen protector which was flat| Subsequently after the release of the S7 phone Zagg produced a protector that has curved edges to match the screen of the S7| When using the flat screen protector on an S7 the edges of the protector tend to chip and split because the edges of the protector do not curve with the screen| Buying the protector at the time of purchasing the phone the sales associate put on a flat protector| Why? The problem with the flat screen is a know problem| I will eventually have to have the screen protector replaced with one that s curved| I just don't get why they installed the problem protector|
negtive,1,Best Buy had only one brand in stock for my my Samsung Galaxy s7 phone| It smudges| leaves your fingerprints| hard to clean| it's not clear| looks dirty when it's actually clean| It doesn't stick properly| there are alot of air bubbles| I personally think is not worth it especially for the price| I would not buy this product/brand again nor would I recommend it| The one I had prior worked better| was cheaper and didn't smudge and was very clear| Also there were no air bubbles| It lasted a long time| I am going to return it| Supposedly this brand has a long warranty which I have to double check| It's kinda hard to know whether or not it's going to work because it's a one shot try and deal|
negtive,3,I've used these products before from this company but find them to be a little bit expensive it doesn't quite cover the screen appropriate age of the bend in the glass on a Galaxy S7 I found that to be the first place that it cracked when I dropped it I need to send it back to the company to see if they truly will replace it heard that they will and I also heard that they have a new product that will cover the screen little bit better will be about $5 more I'm hoping they will replace it with just a newer version however I found other brands and different stores that cost a little bit less actually about half the price sticker glass and covers the screen better not sure if the warranty on the glass to be a forever warranty is worth the price or not yet I would still recommend this product to a friend
negtive,3,We purchased another Zagg Glass after the original one was not meant for our Galaxy 7| We inadvertently purchased the Glass for the Galaxy 7 Edge| This new Glass was sent to us by Zagg| and it still really doesn't fit the screen well| We followed the installation instructions exactly and the Glass is coming away from the screen at the long side of the phone| Both my husband and I have the Galaxy 7 and this is happening to both our phones| My husband's Glass has already cracked at one of the sides that isn't adhering| Neither the crack nor the sides not sticking to the screen is affecting the overall performance of the phone so we will probably just keep these| Our prior phone was a Galaxy 5 with Zagg Glass and we had no issues whatsoever|
negtive,1,I grant you that my review on this item is more a reflection of bad design on Samsung's end| rather than a poorly made product on Zagg's side| The slightly rounded edge around the outside of the screen makes any kind of screen protector not want to stick very well| and this poor adhesion (in my experience with four or five of both the HD glass series and the regular HD Zagg Shields) creates air pockets where the screen protectors just peel up over time and then pop off completely when you try to stick your phone in your pocket| They're a pain| Don't get me wrong - I absolutely love Zagg products| They are excellent| But on these phones (both the S7 and the S7 edge/note)| they are functionally poor| It's better just to buy a cheap double-sided phone protector elsewhere|
negtive,1,installation of the screen protector was easy and worked perfectly until it got to the last 1/8" of the outside edge of the phone| No matter how hard I pressed the adhesive would not stick down| I even put books and weights on top of it| but it still didn't work| Now the edges are open for dust and dirt to get underneath the screen protector and completely ruins the purpose of having one| Now| I not only have to figure out a way to remove the screen protector I also have to purchase a new one|Because it has a lifetime guarantee I can get a new one for free (just pay additional shipping and handling!) but I'm worried it will do the exact same thing! I will not purchase this brand of screen protector in the future|
negtive,1,I bought this 2 days ago and i was so excited being that it seemed to be a great product| Not today i noticed that the sides didn't lay down flush with the phone screen because the screen has a slight curve to the edges(i own the regular S7 not the edge)| Now because the side weren't flush with the phone the screen protector shattered| Ether i am going to have to see if best buy will replace with out the box or wait for zagg to do it and pay at lease $4 more and be right back where i started with a bad design screen protector| Total waste of $40 never buying Zag again| should have stayed with Ghost Armor|
negtive,1,I usually get the high grade| self healing film for my phone| It was not in stock at the store and so this screen protector was recommended by the sales person| They put it on my phone before I left and told me the "halo" around the edge would disappear| It was still there a week later| I received my case a week later and put the case on| The corner caught on the case and "shattered"| NOT GOOD!I did call the store to complain| and was directed to come in for a different screen protector (as I did NOT want the same item replacement from the manufacturer)| When the new screen protector arrived the store did apply it for me and now I'm very happy with my new "film" screen protector| I will not get the glass type screen protector ever again!!!
negtive,2,I purchased my tempered glass screen protector about two months ago| When I went home and applied the screen protector to my phone I was disappointed with the finished product because the edges of the tempered glass would not adhere to the edges of my screen| So I took my phone with the tempered glass back to Best Buy| That is when I found out that a Best Buy professional would have applied the screen protector for me to ensure that it was applied correctly| This is when they also informed me that it would take some time for the edges of the screen protector to adhere to the screen| Two months later and the edges of the screen protector still have not adhered to my phone screen and now the tempered glass has also cracked|
negtive,2,This is the first ZAgg tempered glass protector I have bought and I didnt read the reivews first or I would have passed| The s7 screen slightly rolls back on the sides so the tempered glass doesnt lay against the sides it just floats above the screen| This may be why folks are breaking the things when pulling or retrieving from purses or pockets| The edges snag and crack or chip the tempered glass| I use a tech21 glass that fits snug around the edges so the edges arent out there to snag on stuff so mine hsnt been a problem| The screen saver doesnt effect the high quality of the screen image like the ones I have used in the past so thats a plus| Even if they make these things curved how would you get it to line up? I cant recommend it though until they update the curve issue|
negtive,2,I went into the Best Buy Mobile store that is located in the mall (since the main store would not put this on my phone) and allowed the manager there to do it| He messed up on it when he put it on| and I'm glad he did| I see what everyone is complaining about| On the screen (not the part around the screen that is the color of the phone) about a millimeter from the edge| the glass cover is not mesh with the screen| I played with my phone a little bit to see if it would bother me| and it did| so the manager removed it and had to write it off| I hope they redo this screen| I have seen them on other phones and tablets as well| and they are mesh with the entire face of the phone| and look nice| I would recommend it if they make it fit correctly like it does on the iphone and tablets|
negtive,2,I purchased this product after such great experience in the past with zagg glass shield| I knew at the time of purchase that it doesn't quite fit exact| After reading several reviews|It is noted| on the Galaxy S7| the screen has just a slight curve on the edge| This is not the S7 edge| just the base S7 model| However the Glass Shield does not have the small curve to it This leaves a slight "halo" effect on the sides of the screen| The sales person at best buy kept saying| "this will go away| after a few days|" This has not changed| However I did not expect it to change| After reading information on the Zagg website| I found they are reworking the product and will be putting out a different model in the future that does curve slightly on the edge|
negtive,1,I replaced my Edge with regular S7 and assumed that the glass protector would fit well if I had a flat screen| however the regular S7's screen is not completely flat either (although it is obviously moreso than the Edge) and so the glass protector does not seal fully on both the right and left sides| I've had the protector on for about a week and already have MULTIPLE cracks and breaks in the screen protector| I will not bother having it replaced as it does not fit well in the first place| I looked online (after it was clearly too late at this point) to see if there was a trick to fix it and found that lots of people had similar problems with no solution| Save your time and money and avoid the glass protector!
negtive,2,The Zagg screen saver feels just like the unprotected screen on my Samsung S7| Note I have it on the S7 not the edge | The screen saver went on easily | but I think the edges of the S7 ( not edge ) are slightly curved down and the screen saver does not make full contact with the edges | About 1/8 of an inch on both sides are light gray | I can press the screen saver down on the edges but it pulls right back up | It has not caused any functional problems using the phone | just looks odd |
negtive,1,My fiancé and I both pre-ordered the S7 (I got the Edge)| When we picked them up| he got a case & screen protector| We didn't want to pay $5 for an associate to apply it| so we took care of that at home| I cannot believe how ill fitted it is! The edge on both sides does not fit due to the curve of the phone| so the entire screen is not protected| His screen protector cracked on the edge within 3 days of purchase after he dropped it in the bathroom| I'm so happy to see that Zagg is redesigning them to fit the S7| but I know we won't be able to swap the ill fitted one for it| What a waste of $40! It shouldn't have ever been released if it didn't fit properly| Wait for the remake - DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!
positive,5,I bought this while I was in the store| when a woman came in wanting a new phone because her screen was literally Destroyed! It looked like it was shot with a bullet| The geek squad tech took a look at it and realized she had a ZAGG Screen Protector| He removed it and her phone was in PERFECT CONDITION! She was Amazed| the tech was amazed ( he even said her phone should be the poster child for the ZAGG Protector!)| I was Amazed and Bought one on the Spot!!! And she did not have replacement insurance! She was So Happy and Satisfied!
positive,5,Definite add-on! We put this on my wife's phone since she doesn't have the best track record with phones| and we are very glad we did! Two weeks after putting it on her phone she was buckling herself into the car and she hit the screen of her phone| glancingly| with the buckle| There was a spiderweb crack that appeared on the screen where she hit it| Upon further inspection it turns out that the screen protector did it's job and absorbed all the damage| We filed a claim with Zagg and got the new screen protector in about 4 days| We took the new screen protector and phone down to our local BB and they happily installed the new one free of charge|We'll worth the investment!
positive,5,The Best Buy sales associate recommended that I purchase this Zagg screen protector for my new S7 phone| You can't even tell you have it on the phone| I was able to tap and use all of the selections on my phone easily| Very smooth and clear| Within 3 weeks of having my new phone and this screen protector| I noticed a deep chip on the screen protector and was fearful that it went all the way down through to my phone's screen| But| this Zagg protector did exactly what it was supposed to do| It took the "hit" and saved my phone screen! Then| Zagg replaced the chipped protector like they guarantee! All in all| Best Buy and Zagg and this product were great!
negtive,1,I was very disappointed with the screen protector I had Geek Squad put it on they had told me after then put it on to wait 24 to 48 hours to put the phone back into a case I proceeded have waited at least a week tried to put the phone in the case and started filling up the edges and make bubbles screen protector I do not recommend anybody getting this type of screen protector if you're going to be putting it into a case I just wasted 35 bucks for a screen protector that absolutely did nothing and I will not recommend this to anyone I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but I think that's why I shouldn't make this right with me give me some line of credit but I will not buy a screen protector from them again
negtive,2,This was a very pricey screen protector and I expected it to last with my minimal phone usage and protective care| It cracked within a month| This protector when applied to the galaxy 7| leaves a significant gap between the edge of the screen protector and the phone case| This is where my crack originated| having hit something lightly just on the edge of the screen protector| This product does come with a lifetime warranty I believe and they will replace the protector which requires the cracked one be sent to them| As the crack does not yet bother me to use my phone I have not yet attempted to submit a claim| Hopefully I am not replacing this screen protector regularly| only time will tell|
positive,5,I bought this one to replace the one I purchased a year and a half ago| It's glass so it will crack but it totally protects your screen| If you get a chip in it| you will feel it when you rub your finger across it| but you don't feel the cracks| Easy to install and bubbles are easily removed| The only thing I don't like about it| is it doesn't seem to adhere on the edges| There's a small ring (less than a quarter inch wide) around the outside of the protector that I can't seem to get to stick to the phone| Maybe this is by design so you can easily remove it?
negtive,3,I purchased two of these screen protectors| one for an S7 black and another for an S7 gold| Surprisingly the screen protector did not fully adhere to the black S7 and had a visible halo on the edges where the protector could not stick due to a very slight curve of the screen edges| The gold S7 did not have this problem and the protector worked fine| sticking completely without the halo| If you run into this issue| Zagg upgraded me to the Glass curve protector through their warranty program| which worked on the black S7| Not sure why they haven't fully addressed this| Never had a problem with a Zagg product before| Just be aware of your model before buying|
negtive,1,I had the salesperson install this when setting up the S7 and it wasn't his 1st installation but even though this is not the S7 edge the cover never laid down to the edges| It left a 1/8 inch wide gray line all the way around the screen| Great for catching pocket lint I thought|| You could press it down but it would come back up instantly| The case was not on it| so it wasn't the case| I gave up until the next morning and tried again and it started chipping and cracking on the edges| this will be my 1st and last glass cover| Going to back to get the non glass HD like I had on my S5 and hope that works and hope to get my money back on this one|
negtive,3,I had to get this replaced a few months after purchase due to it breaking/tearing/cracking| It cut my finger when I tried to use my phone| Best buy replaced it and re-installed the new one| It worked good again for a few months| then started to lift in the upper corner| then cracked on one side| then cracked again below the first crack| The cracks are small enough and close enough to the edge they haven't cut my finger yet| I will have to replace soon| though| I'm sure| I had a better one on my last phone| but can't remember what the name of it was|
positive,4,My husband is on his third Zagg screen protector| He keeps dropping his phone and he is very glad he purchased this particular screen protector| We like Zagg because unlike others you are not required to return the item to receive the replacement| The first time his protector broke they had one in stock at our Best Buy store and he was able to replace it on the spot| The second time the store was out of stock so they ordered one which came within two business days of ordering| Very good customer service|
positive,4,We have always used Zagg protectors| First I tried the Zagg curved glass protector| Not sure if we had a defective one| but the protector didn't seem to adhere to the screen except around the very edge| After a week| I put a Otterbox Symmetry case on the phone and Zagg curve glass protector popped off| When touching the center of the protector there was no adhesive to the touch except around the edges| Then I got the standard (non curved) Zagg| It works better with the Otterbox Symmetry case| The one negative for this product is the glass on the S7 has a slight curve| The Zagg doesn't contour to this curve| So you get a halo around the protector which dust/dirt gets under|
negtive,1,This screen cover is a joke| especially at $40||| heck I wouldn't recommend it if it was $1||| I decided to splurge on it (in store w/of looking up reviews) because I thought zagg was supposed to make the best tempered glass protectors| As others have mentioned the sides do not adhere at all due to mild curves of the screen| I was meticulous putting this on my 1 day old phone and I can guarantee it wasnt my fault| Luckily best buy gave me a refund| but these are a total scam and seriously need to be taken off the shelves!
positive,4,So i was told about this by one of the Bestbuy phone people| and after hearing him put about how great it was i gave it a try| the first problem i have with it was fit| the edges of the protector don't fit flush with my phone and are a little lifted and would catch things if the phone was not in a case and are a bit sharp| As for the protection it does not get scratched up like the plastic ones would or mine has not yet| The last thing is some how the protector has cracked on one of the edges even tho the phone is in an otterbox| i feel this happend due to the edge not being fully attached to the phone| Even with the minor things i have problems with i would still get another|
positive,4,I've always been a great supporter of the Zagg Glass shields| This was the one time where I was only a little disappointed| but the curved edges of the phone didn't help that| So it's not entirely the screen's fault| However| the first day I accidentally dropped it| the protector chipped in a couple spots| Definitely a bummer| I've only had the phone with protector for 4 months| and the wear is definitely noticeable after only a handful of drops: a couple cracks| 3 chips| and one corner that no longer sticks down| Nevertheless| it has held up well| The lifetime warranty is always worth it| and I'll probably get a new protector through that soon|
positive,5,I gave 5 stars because the product itself is great in my opinion| I love zagg glass screen protectors but this one is not the right fit for the Galaxy S7 due to the slight curve on the sides of the phone| The shield stays uplifted on the sides which caused the shield to crack on the bottom right edge of the screen protector being that it does not lay flat on the phone screen| It was installed at Best Buy at the time of purchase| I will definitely continue to buy zagg glass screen protectors again for my other products but not for this phone unless the protector is slightly curved like the phone| I would recommend this product but not for this phone|
negtive,1,The clarity and smoothness are fantastic in the VERY middle of the screen| but they didn't account for the curved edges of the phone (even the standard Galaxy S7 has a fairly substantial curve)| This means the side edges of the screen protector DO NOT sit on the screen correctly and leaves a "halo" on both sides of the phone (where the glass doesn't meet the screen)| which causes constant problems with touch screen functionality and looks ungodly| Do not buy this!
negtive,3,In less than a month I have used the warranty to replace a cracked screen protector and I already have cracks in the replacement| I am a HUGE fan of the tempered glass screen protectors but have not had much luck with this one| I previously had a Zagg tempered glass protector and I managed to go almost 2 years without cracks etc| I don't feel that I have dropped my phone anymore than usual so Im not sure why I am having more problems| Also it doesn't seem to seal completely around the edge| there is 1/8" border that starts to look gross after a month| I give the company props for offering a warranty though| glass is much better looking than the film protectors|
negtive,3,Only 3 compliments with 3 complaints 1|Clear| it makes your phone looks new!2| Left no fingerprints or dirty marks on the center side of cover|3| It's another glass on the glass| so it might protect the screen very well if accident happens|Why minus the stars||1| The size did not cover the whole actual screen|||2| Every edges of this protector didnt stick to the actual phone's screen very well|| (maybe because this product is too thick?)3| Because of the reason above| it leaves room for dust or dirt to stay on the edges of my phone' screen|
negtive,1,Bought this as my 7th ZAGG screen protector and I am very dissappointed to say it's a bad product that does NOT fit the Samsung Galaxy S7 device| When I contacted ZAGG today after purchasing last night and discovering it did not fit properly| they acknowledged that the products do not fit and while they are working on a Glass Curve that does fit| it will not be out until 2017| They offered me the alternative replacement of the glass (which I know from reviews doesn't fit) or the HD Clear| They can only replace and not refund products purchased from 3rd party sellers| DO NOT BUY!! So sad to say they just lost a lifetime customer!
negtive,2,See My review Feb 26| This product does not fit the Galaxy S7 (not edge)| It is functional and will protect| but leaves an one eighth halo on the outer edges where it cannot adhere to the screen due to the slight curve of the screen on the standard S7| After one month of use I have not had the problem others have had with dirt/lint collecting under the screen edges| The new Zagg Glass Curve for the S7 is now available from Zagg| However| it still is not all clear| The top and bottom are black opaque and will cover the color of your phone| Until they offer an all clear Glass Curve| I will continue to use this unit|
negtive,1,Although this is "designed" for the Galaxy S7| it does not fit| The S7 has a slight curve around the edge and this protector does not take that into consideration| Best Buy unsuccessfully tried installing this three times before advising it is not designed properly to fit this phone| If installed| you will see a halo affect 1/8" - 1/4" around the whole phone| This halo easily chips and cracks| The sales rep advised Best Buy should've removed these from the shelves (she removed the ones at this store)| Zagg is also aware this does not fit the phone properly and have come out with a curved edge version (for this S7)|
negtive,2,Got this shield 30 dais ago because of the clarity| It is very clear and easy to clean| But doesn't fit the S7 very well and there is a halo around the edge where it won't smooth down| My husband dropped his phone 2 foot onto a rubber mat and it hit the corner| | pushing the cover against the halo edge| which caused the glass to splinter| Would suggest getting one that is a better fit| or not glass| Picture shows splinter and halo around edges| Thankfully Zagg|com has a lifetime warranty
negtive,1,Like the previous reviews state| it doesn't lay flat at the edges of the screen and I have the S7| When I was in Best Buy I asked the rep if the protector would go to the edge of the screen because my Otterbox one didn't and I asked if it was because the curve at the edges of the screen| He said it would fit no problem| but it doesn't| I went to Invisible Shield's website and saw they are coming out with the glass protector that will go with the curve for the S7 and Edge| I added myself to the waiting list but I already threw out the packaging and the receipt for the one I have now so I think I'm SOS|
positive,5,What can I say about zagg||||it truly is the best| I use it for all of my devices and cannot begin to explain the amount of money it has saved me| Initial cost of $40 will tend to push some people away for a cheaper screen protector| please resist this urge| I've literally shut my phone in between my car door and the body of my car with no breakage| Once the zagg has cracked/broken| just peel it off and send back for a FREE Warranty replacement| It's that simple| Purchase for almost any phone and computer screen| It bets paying $100 ir more to get something fixed| Trust me| you'll make your money back in no time|
negtive,2,I've been a long time user of Zagg Products and this one just dissapoints| I've had it fitted since I first got the S7 and already has a hairline crack across the screen and 2 pin point cracks at the edges of the screen| I've had Zagg glass fitted on my Apple ipod 5th gen with similar problems and had it for a while before I had problems| I've also had privacy glass fitted on my S5 with no problems at all| First when applying it| the left and right edges don't completely stick| And now I have a couple cracks| I haven't had it for long and pretty disappointing it has only been a couple weeks|
negtive,1,it's rare that I am unhappy with something I was recommended to buy at your store but here you go| it just happenedI just bought and it literally broke on installationit's supposed to be a "glass" quality screen and WHILE I was applying it because the edge of the screen would not contact with the screen and I GENTLY pressed as recommended || it shattered|of course I am going to ask for a lifetime warranty replacement from Zagg but I will have to pay for shipping| this product is clearly a piece of junk
positive,4,I have a reputation for cracking my screens| quite horribly| I am a bit clumsy with my phones| With my most recent phone i decided to take a little more caution| Id researched different screen protectors offered by best buy| This was what I thought to be the best| I've had a few tumbles and the screen is still in great shape almost a month after purchasing the protector| In fact i cracked the protector a tiny bit| but it did its job| the actual screen was safe| My only negative about the product is that the edging of the protector doesn't go all the way to the out edge of the phone|
negtive,2,I originally bought this protector on sale (it was a nice deal since I figured it would be better than a plastic one for about the same price) But I have to say I'm disappointed| The glass was pealing up at the slightly curved edges of the phone so dirt and dust could get under it| I was also worried about it cracking there| I've never had a glass screen protector before so I'm not sure if it was a problem I had or just a "feature" of glass ones| but I found that I really had to press on the screen a lot to get the touch screen work| I registered the warranty on the Zagg website| but honestly| I won't be replacing it|
negtive,1,First things first| these screen protectors are fantastic| With thay being said| this particular screen protector DOES NOT fit the S7 screen| The screen of the S7 has a very slight| but noticeable curve at the edges| This screen protector lies flat and does not curve with the screen| leaving a "halo" effect on the sides| Over time| dust and debris builds up underneath| Zagg is currently working on developing a better screen protector for this phone| Buy a cheaper one until that one is released|TL;DRIt doesn't fit the phone| Buy a cheap protector until Zagg releases the new version|
negtive,1,I paid $50 each for 3 Zagg HD Glass Screen Protectors for my 2 new Samsung Galaxy S7's and S6 phones| ALL 3 of them cracked within 3-4 weeks of purchase| Bestbuy covers 14 days so I had to deal with Zagg for the lifetime warranty| Each time it took several weeks to get the replacement and they sent me the wrong model and also sent me the dry protectors instead of the glass| This is the 3rd time I am waiting for them to send me the CORRECT replacements and I have only had the phones since 4/8/16| I've had cheap $5 protectors that have lasted the lifetime of the phones that were far superior to Zaggs in my opinion|
positive,4,Disappointed that this glass Shield cracked after two days| However the sales associate at Best Buy put it on and told me that there are sometimes problems with this on the Galaxy S7| but never expected it to crack in 2 days| Went online to Zagg to register and then also request a replacement and saw that Best Buy was $5 more then buying directly from Zagg| Going in to the Best Buy store and hoping they will make this right by refunding me $5 as well as giving me a replacement so I don't have to go through warranty and wait a week to get a new one online|
negtive,1,I got my phone early through a pre-order from t-mobile| I was surprised to see this on the shelf so I bought it| It fits poorly as the protection is flat and the Galaxy S7 has slightly curved edges around the glass| (I do not own the S7 Edge)| This makes it difficult to use the screen and keyboard sometimes as the borders of the glass stay somewhat elevated once applied| This product should be recalled|
negtive,1,This glass protector is a mess| It doesn't lay flat on the screen| so there is a lifted area around the edge of the whole phone| which wouldn't be an issue| except that if you look at it wrong it cracks| I dropped a wood lip liner pencil on my phone and the edge chipped and cracked like I'd just dropped it on cement| Absolutely ridiculous for what I paid for it| Replaced it once| thinking it was a fluke| then pulled my phone out of my purse to find the same issue| from the phone just being inside of my purse| Not worth the money| I'll just buy a cheap replacement on amazon|
negtive,3,I had the GEEK SQUAD install my cover at BEST BUY| The results were not as well as I would have liked| He broke the first one and got another off the shelf and then told me"If this one breaks or chips no problem just email the manufacturer and they will replace it| It doesn't seem to fit the curve of the phone| I purchased the name brand to go with that phone| The cover is dull and not as transparent as I like| I have purchased glass covers before and I have been satisfied| The cost of the glass cover and installation was about 50 dollars| I will possibly buy somewhere else and save money next time|
negtive,2,There is a slight curve on the edges of the Galaxy S7| so the screen protector doesn't touch the whole screen| I dropped it once on my kitchen floor and the corner cracked| There's already a ton of dust in the 1/8th inch gaps around the edge| and I've only had the phone for 4 days| The only good thing is that I was told you can register your product online and get a lifetime warranty so you could keep replacing them| but it may not be worth the hassle if you have to replace it often|On a positive note| it does protect from scratches in the middle of the screen|
positive,4,I had the same thing for my S5 and the lifetime guarantee was a godsend| I had to pay for shipping| but I used it at least 4-5 times over 2|5 years| I'm not a fan of the otterbox/lifeproof style screen covers personally| But I'm as clumsy as anyone and the screen would've been cracked many times over without the glass| For the S7 the only drawback is this version doesn't bend to cover the curved edges| So eventually the edges will get dirty| That's why only 4 stars| But currently it seems like all the curved screen protectors don't stay on too well yet| So this is a decent compromise|
negtive,3,This particular Zagg shield for the Samsung Galaxy S7 has issues| I have had at least 3 replacements since I got my phone last summer| The way that it curves along the face of the phone is a slight bevel| therefore dirt and dust and fuzz accumulate around the edges all the time - even using an Otterbox| My son's has cracked twice and every once in awhile we get them slightly defective out of the box| Zagg is a super company with amazing customer service| so returning it (if registered online) is never a problem - but you do pay $5|99 for shipping and a new one is always sent out|
positive,5,For all our family's smartphones and tablets| we've purchased InvisibleShield products| The current Glass HD styles are very good| They're easy to place on the device's screen and protect from wear and tear| On a couple of occasions| the protector broke| but it protected the devices screen - just as advertised! With the lifetime warranty| it's a simple process to contact Zagg and a replacement shield is mailed| We'll continue to purchase InvisibleShield products in the future|
negtive,1,If I could rate this product for zero stars I would| Touch ability was not compromised| The problem with this product is that you cannot keep it on the phone long enough to get decent use out of it (Samsung Galaxy S 7)| The product will not lie flat on the screen edges| it lifts on the screen edges causing air bubbles together between the protector and the phone screen| Also it chips and cracks constantly| The phone is not subject to a harsh environment| it mainly stays on my desk or in my pocket| Exchange process is poor| Not recommended at least for this application|
negtive,1,For the price you pay for the tempered glass you kinda think they would have the design worked out| the Galaxy S7 (Not the Edge) has a slight curve to the screen| This specific product is straight and will cause problems do not waste your money| Zagg is aware of the situation but doesn't have a set time when they will have replacements for them| you can see down below with the picture|
positive,4,When I dropped the phone| this saved my screen| But the downside was|even though you get one free replacement guarantee| Make sure the Zagg Company sends you the right size| After the broken screen was taken off| it was discovered it was the wrong size| So I had to buy another one from Best Buy in order to protect my phone| The Zagg company was sorry and is ending me another of the correct size(of which I do not need now)| Of course it has been over 3 weeks and I have not seen it| I am not pleased with this situation|
positive,5,for big things big solutions our technology is increibe in a screen we have a complete world| but that would be of the world without the adequate protections for our treasures (smart phones) screens cases and all that || but the most incredible that a blink of applications you can handle from the lumimacion of your house asta video cameras and alarms is very interesting to see how the technology advances|
negtive,1,Purchased this out of necessity after getting a new phone and wanted protection from day one| Had this on for a day and it began detaching from the outer edges on both sides of the screen| It also cracked from the slightest bump into a Formica counter top that fell from my hand that was laying on the table top! Don't waste your money on this junk| have had much better luck buying $5 ones that last longer and are much cheaper to replace since you still have to pay for shipping & handling despite the supposed "lifetime warranty" to receive a replacement|
negtive,3,Bought one at Verizon for my son's S7 and it was perfect| I liked it so much I bought a second here at Best Buy for my S7 unfortunately it isn't perfect there is a 1/8th inch halo around the perimeter that allows particles under the screen protector| I will contact ZAGG for a replacement I hope the replacement is better|5 Stars for quality of the glass itself| 2 Stars for consistency of their adhesive| If you don't mind going back to ZAGG for replacements I would recommend if not don't bother|
negtive,2,It is OK| but I would feel safer with the glass protection I had on my S5| Because the Pt case is useless| (the case falls off when i am holding it| and when the phone drops| the case splits off immediately)| the screen protector started peeling off after I had it on for 20 minutes| I even waited 48 hours after having BB put the Zagg on before putting the case on| (so this is absolutely a case issue)| but if it were the glass version| it wouldn't be able to peel off so easily|Very disappointed overall-case| screen protector| wireless charger|||||:o(
negtive,3,The problem is the slightly curved edge on the S7| Some screen protectors are short and just cover the flat part| Others go edge-to-edge but leave about 1/8 inch on each side that is not completely flat against the glass| This one goes edge to edge| It interferes a bit when typing at the edge (like q| p| 1| 0) or using the extreme edges| but is something I got used to| I use it with a Speck cover and haven't noticed dirt or dust get under the edges| even though I regularly run on dusty trails| I'll put "yes" to recommend| but| really| you decide|
negtive,3,Great product| good clarity| good sensitivity with touch| but||| As noted in other reviews it does not seal around the sides due to the rounding of the edge of the screen| Pairing with a good case like and Otterbox or similar can help close the gap a little keep some of the pocket lint at bay| I would recommend this product but with warning that it will probably have a shortened lifespan because of the ability of dirt and lint to get under the edge of the glass| For that same reason I can only give it 3 out of 5 stars
negtive,1,I purchased the Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 and only until after the Geek Squad installed it on my phone| I saw that it did not curve where the phone did| Matter of fact| I ended up calling Zagg to ask if their product was made that way and the customer service rep I spoke with said it was indeed made that way; and since the S7 was released| they've created the Glass Curve| I was able to get a refund from Best Buy to purchase a screen protector that actually fit my phone|
negtive,2,The screen protector does what it is supposed and protects the screen| however| the rounded edges of the Galaxy S7 create a halo effect | The halo effect is due to the protector not being flush with the screen on the edges| therefore making it very easy to crack| Didn't have the phone more more than a week before I had cracks all over the protector just from normal every day use| Had the same protector on my old Galaxy S4 and never had this problem in 2 years| I'm considering just taking the protector off because the cracks obstruct the view of the screen|
negtive,1,First of all I want to say that Zagg is an awesome company with an incredible customer service department| The are fast & will do everything they can to assist you| I have had their products on several different phones & they were incredible| I didn't read the reviews for this product because of the trust I had| Big mistake| Same as everyone else here| i have the halo because of slight bevel in glass| How it has got almost 4 star rating is beyond me| Don't buy this & BB take it off the shelf please! Still waiting to hear back from Zagg customer service|
negtive,3,As most| I hate screen protectors mainly because it's so hard to get the air bubbles out & doesn't feel like a screen anymore| With the invisibleshield| it's simple to put on & doesn't take anything away from the screen| Unfortunately| after 2 weeks of use| the screen protector accidentally lifted up| I pressed it back down not expecting anything of it| When I was able to take a look at my phone I discovered my screen protector had broken| when I went to take it off it shattered in a glass shattering effect| It's a great product but pretty fragile|
negtive,3,I'm not particularly excited about this product| Pros - easy to apply and through instructions| it does protect my screen and is on the thick side| very clear an no bubbles because of it being glass| Cons - because of the thickness I need to press a bit harder on the touchscreen| doesn't lay flat on the edges| cracked on the edge within 2 days and now there are many shatters along the edges - I'm guessing in part because of the lifted edges| I think $40 is a bit too much to pay for this item but I'm glad it's at least holding up for protection|
negtive,3,The product is good but after a few weeks the product is starting to lift at the corners of phone| This makes for a annoying sight and continuous smoothing of the product that doesnt adhere to the phone anymore| For the price i would think this wouldn't happen| The product does the job and does not restrict functioning| I wonder how long before it starts getting bigger and doesnt serve its purpose| I paid Geek Squad to do the install of the shield to avoid issues like this| I did read this was an issue but didnt think it would be immediate as it was|
positive,4,I wanted a good screen protector for my Samsung S7| The only problem is not the fault of the screen protector but because the screen on the S7 is ever so slightly curved| Since the screen protector is glass| it gets these tiny little cracks on the right and left side of it| However| this has not caused a problem with my use of the screen nor do the cracks expand| I knew this might happen before I bought it as the salesperson let me know it might happen| which was good|||I didn't feel ripped off when it did happen|
negtive,3,I recently bought a Zagg screen protector from a different retailer and it was terrible| I felt it was my application that was the issue and a lesser version| We bought a better version from Best buy and at first appeared to be better| However the edges wouldn't adhere on either side| Its exactly the same on each| It looked like it should have been for an Edge S7| not regular S7| We checked to see if that was the case but it was not|||Its annoying but im not spending anymore money on a protector until I need to|
negtive,1,I thought I would upgrade from the Zagg plastic protectors I've used in the past and buy a glass one for my new Galaxy S7| Big mistake| The glass on the phone is curved; the screen protector is flat| There is therefore about 5mm of the edge where the screen protector is not in contact with the glass| The is going to invite dust and dirt between the phone and the protector| I'm returning mine tomorrow|
positive,4,My previous phone died but I had it awhile so when I got a new phone| I had to get a screen protector| Whoa| The prices have gone up in the past few years| That was an eye-opener but that said| I'm glad that I have a screen protector| This product was easy to put on and take off if adjustment needed| It doesn't interfere in functionality| Overall| it does what I need so while it was pricey (to me)| it was also worth it|
negtive,1,I have been buying Zagg protectors for years and this is the first time I have had a problem| I have had this for about 3 weeks| The Best Buy rep said that the halo effect would go away within a week| What actually happened is| the halo effect caused lint to accumulate| and caused cracking at the edges within a week| 3 weeks in and there are 4 chunks missing from the edges| I keep this phone in my pocket about 90% of the time| and have never dropped the phone| It makes the edges of the screen nearly impossible to use| Terrible product|
negtive,3,The screen protector is easy to install| clear| easy to see through however| the screen doesn't respond as quick or as well with it as with other clear protectors|Also| this unit had a small chip on the upper left hand corner| which I decided to ignore| The chip has been increasing in size and it looks as it there's another starting on the left edge about half-way down the phone|Once this "protector" flakes to the point it interfears with the phone screen| I'll take it out and get something else|
negtive,2,Bought 2 of these when we upgraded our phones| Supposedly these were the best ones they had for the Samsung Galaxy 7| We had the employee put them on before we left with the new phones| The edges underneath the whole cover already has collected a ton of dust on both phones| One has collected so much underneath that it got flipped up and cracked the corner of my screen shield| Pretty disappointed since we haven't even had them a full month! Next time I'll just buy some cheap universal screen protector because those cost less and have the same result|
negtive,3,I purchased the ZAGG shield primarily because I had cracked 2 screens on two of my phone in the last 2 months| and it was on sale| I bought it for my S7 and had the store associate affix it| The end result is a 3mm perimeter that doesn't adhere to the glass| Apparently even the regular S7 (ie| non edge) is rounded on the edges| This creates a visible line where the glass shield is raised above the phone screen and has the potential of collecting dust and making it more visible|
negtive,2,I have purchased a lot of zagg screen protectors for everything from my cell phones to tablets and have loved their products| This is the first product that has proven to be inferior in use| The problem with this Samsung screen protector is the sides of the phone screen are curved down and the screen protector tends to come up off the sides| You cannot make it stay down and to take it up and try to reapply it does not work| I would have thought Zagg would have came up with a solution to this before putting it out on the market|
negtive,2,Love thr zaag glass screen protection and the feel of glass but not a fan of the s7 version that adds the "pocket lint boarder"| The overall dimensions of the screen protector are perfect amd it feels great only downside is the s7 glass is curved slightly at the sides and the zaag glass is not| You end up with a not so nice gap around the edges after about 2 days| Then the pocket lint sstarts to collect and after a week you have a very visible lifted edge with fuzz| Lifting it to clean only makes it worse over time|
negtive,3,I started purchasing the glass screen protectors when i saw how it literally kept my wife's actual phone screen from cracking| She cracked 2 different glass screen protectors but the phone itself was fine! However| the design for the s7 sucked| The edges wouldn't stay down they seemed lifted| I had to go back the day after purchasing to get a new one and while the associate tried his best| even with the new one the edges wouldn't stay down so I had to purchase a different type of screen protector| If zaag will fix the design it would be 5 star!
negtive,1,I've bought/applied many Zagg glass screen protectors in my time| Usually| they are fantastic| This was not the case this time| The screen on an S7 is slightly curved on the edge (obviously not as much as the S7 edge)| but a curve| none-the-less| is present|The screen protector is just slightly too large and does not lay flush with the screen on the extreme edges| Its not terribly noticeable| but considering you'll be looking at the phone all the time| it will start to bother you|
positive,5,As with the several phones I have had these on in the past| this screen protector has saved my actual screen from a great deal of damage| This was a replacement for the same protector that I have had on the phone for about 18 months now| While the protector was broken on most of the corners| it did its job perfectly|The protector WILL NOT seat on the edges of the Galaxy S7 because the screen is slightly rounded right at the edge| This does not affect the protection| though|
negtive,1,The majority was right| I was hoping the sides coming unattached/up would be minimal and I would just deal with it since I liked the idea of having the glass version of a screen protector| WRONG||||| the worst product I've had yet| Sides came up| which then moved inward - to the point that only the center section of the screen had the adhesive sticking| Heed the warnings| do not purchase! The only saving grace is the companies replacement warranty| which was used to replace it with a new option of screen protection|
negtive,1,This screen protector is very pricey and should be perfect for the price| Unfortunately| it is far from it| As other reviews have stated| the edges of the screen protector do not adhere to the screen because of the slight curve| It also does not reach to the edge of the screen to protect all of the front| I should have kept my receipt because this product is not worth buying at all|
negtive,1,Clarity and touch is great UNTIL it cracks on the edge| For me it was the "swipe screen to unlock" that did it| And then the hairline cracks start to appear and then it just becomes unusual| The clarity is pointless at this point| It started after only a couple of months| A huge disappointment and waste of money! I emailed zagg & they said they'd replace it with the same one|||the curved one is on backorder| This product should be RECALLED & best buy should refund the purchase price| Bestbuy says to contact ZAGG| :(
positive,5,This is the best "insurance" you can ever buy to protect your phone's screen! I have dropped my phone on multiple occasions and at least twice I thought I had cracked the screen||||nope| it was only the screen protector which Zagg cheerfully replaced| Do not waist your money buying a less expensive product because as they say| "you get what you pay for"| Also| in addition to the protection of the screen| the product reduces glare and allows for easy cleaning of smudges and fingerprints| Again| BEST accessory for a phone!
positive,5,I had another similar product which also worked great| but I beat it up pretty bad while my phone was in a Fanny Pack| I thought I actually broke the glass so I went to a Phone repair shop| They directed me to Best Buy after telling me it was the cover not the Glass I damaged| Best Buy installed it and until now I forgot I even bought it| Its great and barely know its there| Recommend for sure and recommend the Professional Install!
negtive,1,This is my first time buying a glass screen protector|| an probably my last| I've always gotten invisableshield but never the glass| Stick with the non-glass ones and you'll never be disappointed| I currently have 3 cracks and scratches and I can't remember dropping it ever in the last 3 months I've had it| any more than like 2/3 ft and it's already trashed|| Not very thrilled| It does NOT fit the galaxy 7 very well and there's a huge lift around the screen causing dust an junk to get in and make it look dirty|
negtive,2,I used it for some time| BUT I should have listened to the sales person who warned me that it does not fit perfectly on my SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 Cell Phone| It had a 2mm ring around the whole display| where it did not attach to the glass screen| which is curved backwards| I wanted some protection against scratches| so I left it on until these edge| which did not bend to the form of the glass| collected to much dirt and i removed it|So| 2 points for the time it worked|BUT: Do NOT use it for the SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 !!!
negtive,3,I had read how the standard S7 has a rounded screen near the edges and that tempered glass protectors weren't fitting quite right| I was assured by BRB that this wasn't true for this protector| Well it is| So the left and right edges have 2-3 mm line along each edge that looks like a bubble but is just the curvature in the screen| It doesn't affect anything but I was upset that the staff was either misinformed| Still I would rather have my screen protected than not so I kept it| Shouldn't cost as much as it does or the poor aesthetics|
positive,5,My Samsung 7 was going on 2 years and developed several cracks in the protective glass screen| I went to Best Buy (BB) to see what types of glass screens they had| The member of the staff recommended I go with the ZAGG Invisible Shield Glass| Not only was it a drastic improvement in the clarity of the screen but I saved a considerable amount because it was on sale| It was also worth the cost of having BB install the glass as they did a truly superb job| Another well done for Best Buy!!
negtive,1,As nearly ever reviewer has noted| the flat design does not fit the curvature of the glass on the edges of the Galaxy S7| From their web site| I can see that they are working on a new one| I understand that this happens when products are produced without the exact specifications| I get that| But I sincerely hope that I will not have to pay an additional $40 (or more!) to buy the same product that I thought I was buying the first time|
negtive,3,It's great for protecting my phone screen from getting scratched| but honestly for the price I payed for this I don't like the way it collects dust and dirt around the edges one of the corners seems to want to come up and now I have a Crack in the bottom with a piece that's ready to break off right down by my button| This isn't supposed to Crack or break and I haven't done anything to it so I don't understand especially since it does have a case around it| So for the enormous price I wouldn't do this one again|
negtive,2,I BOUGHT THIS SCREEN COVER BECAUSE THE SALESPERSON SAID THEY WERE GOOD AND I HAD BOUGHT A THINNER CASE| SO I WANTED THE EXTRA PROTECTION FOR MY SCREEN| HOWEVER| WITHIN DAYS| THE SCREEN HAD SCRATCHES ON IT FROM SLIDING IT IN AND OUT OF PURSE| I GUESS| I'VE IT A LITTLE OVER 2 MONTHS NOW AND THE SIDES OF THE SCREEN COVER ARE CRACKING OFF| AT LEAST IT'S THE COVER AND NOT THE ACTUAL PHONE| BUT FOR THE PRICE| I WISH I WOULD'VE JUST BOUGHT THE CHEAPER ONES I CAN AFFORD TO REPLACE EVERY FEW MONTHS INSTEAD|||
negtive,1,I bought this for my new s7 after having great experiences with other Zagg glass screen protectors on other phones and tablets| I installed it on my phone| but it never really looked right|||I noticed the edges were blurry and I was getting lint and other fuzzies stuck to the edge of the screen protector| I then read reviews on BestBuy|com and saw that many other people were having the same problems| I pulled the screen protector off my phone and returned it to my local store| I'll wait for Zagg to release the curved version!
negtive,2,I had never had a tempered glass cover before just screen protectors| Got phone out of purse one day||and the tempered glass cover was cracked| At that point I had never dropped my phone or had it in any situation that would have caused that "shattering" of the screen protector| That being said if there was a situation and I was unaware my screen was totally untouched| However| I went back to screen protectors only not the tempered glass| Suppsed to have Gorilla glass anyway so I am saving my $$$
positive,4,Got a new phone and repurchase this for my new phone| Both my husband and I had them for are old phones and we never broke our screen| We did have to replace it once on my phone (my preschooler launched my phone)| and 2 times for my husband (he's just hard on stuff| construction/mechanic)| Just make sure you register with Zagg right away saves time looking for the receipt later| All in all $5|99 for replacement (shipping) way better than new screen protector or new phone because the screens broken|
positive,5,I returned a screen protector that I had bought when I first got my new phone| That protector was supposed to fit my phone but kept coming up around the edges| Went into the Best Buy Tracy and I talked to the department manager she determined that the problem was with the protector that I previously had purchased| She installed the new protector and I immediately saw a difference| She refunded me for my old one and completed the sale of the new one| Surprised my wife and I as to the professional service we received|
negtive,1,This product would be acceptable if it fit the phone screen properly| Left and right sides of screen protector do not match the contour of phone screen (you can see a "border" where the screen protector does not contact the phone screen)| This in turn causes the screen protector to interfere with the phone case on the lower corners -- screen protector peels up on lower corners|Bottom line| something this expensive needs to fit properly|
negtive,1,Right after I bought it because of the stupid design| The sides cracked| They just came out with the correct design called the curve that covers the whole thing| What an upgrade that one is AWESOME! But forget about getting your phone wet| Learned the hard way| Once you put on the curve model and get it wet| You will need to use the warranty as the water stays between the zagg and the glass of the phone| $3|99 and got a new one on the way| So make sure you don't buy this one for the S7| You need the s7 curve model !
negtive,3,For a think piece of glass film| it is pricey| It doesn't appear to affect the touch screen and is able to stay relatively clean and clear (smudge resistant)| It protects the screen well; cracked in multiple places when dropped but my screen was undamaged| The limited lifetime warranty helps so you can get a replacement if the glass cracks but the shipping fees are expensive for the free replacement| Customer service for ZAGG has been great regarding the replacement|
negtive,1,I have loved the glass products for my iPhones| This one for the Galaxy S7 did not live up to expectations| Even though my phone is not the S7 Edge the screen has a slight curve at the edges| Since this Glass screen cover is rigid it does not follow the curve around the perimeter of the screen leaving a 2mm gap| I realize that 2mm is not much| but I would expect a product that is listed as being for this particular phone would have a perfect fit|
negtive,1,In less than 30 days of use| this item is cracked and there are 4 shattered edges| When the edges shatter| they are sharp| like glass| A piece got stuck in my finger and it was difficult to extract| I do not abuse my items| as the last similar product I had (different brand) lasted for over 2 years without any damage| I have not idea why this product is so fragile| The clarity is very good but the product itself is too fragile for general use| I will need to return it for credit or replacement|
negtive,1,I love the concept| but the execution is poor| Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect anything different| but if you are going to provide a screen shield for a phone with a slightly beveled edge| I would expect it either to work with the bevel or stop short| so that the shield fully adheres to the screen| This was never the case and I even paid extra to have it professionally installed at Best Buy| From the very first| the edges didn't adhere and began collecting dust| making my phone seem dirty| I finally gave up on it|
negtive,3,The Samsung S7 has a slight curve on the edges which make this glass protector not fit properly| It does not adhere properly as mine cracked within a few days and I don't drop or mishandle my phone| My son also has the same phone| but he has a heavy duty Otter Box case and his has not cracked| He is more abusive with his phone| Hopefully they have corrected the glass screen by now as I have had it about 6 months now| Zagg does offer lifetime warranty| so they do replace it| you just pay for shipping cost|
positive,5,my old screen protector cracked when I rolled onto it doing some work in the garage with a bolt in my pocket| the device screen was untouched| so| this purchase was pretty mindless| the young woman that helped me knew exactly what I needed and installed it quickly and perfectly| the screen is perfect and use is flawless| with regard to the touchscreen performance| I would purchase this again in a heartbeat and track down the young woman that helped me anytime I am in the store|
negtive,1,Not only does it not contour to the screen of my phone but it also cracks very easily| I have only had it a week and it has 3 cracks| I know how one happened| when it hit the countertop in the bathroom when I was putting it down| No idea about the other 2| Very disappointing since I decided to pay more for quality| Product is registered with Zagg but I don't even want a replacement if it's just going to break again and again| They still make you pay shipping and handling for a poorly made product|
negtive,1,I was very excited to see that zagg had the screen protectors out early this launch| but when I got home and put on the screen I noticed it didn't fully adhere to the edges of the screen| Went back to return it right away| Their "pro" at putting on protectors said it was placed perfectly and he didn't know why it was lifting| Got my money back and went to an actual zagg store where they said that the curved glass won't be coming out for a bit|
positive,4,The screen does it job| I won't argue that| but it isn't like the video trailer describing the product claimed| Hammers and fireworks weren't supposed to damage this| It's supposed to be military grade| but on the bottom right corner| not even a week after putting it on| my teeth (not even a hard bite)| cracks it| A drop to the ground made a half circle crack| The phone is protected (to my knowledge)| but the screen shouldn't be damaged from this| Not if it was as described|
negtive,1,Purchased this product at the recommendation of a Best Buy employee| who had used it on another phone|When I installed it| i noticed the edges would did not make contact with the phone| The S7 has a downward slope around the edge of the screen and because this product is not flexible| it can't wrap around the screen|Very disappointed with this product| it really should be pulled off the store shelves|
positive,5,With the high price of cell phones today| it pays to invest in a screen protector| I have used the plastic screen protectors in the past and found that they make the screen a little cloudy and the images are not crystal clear| This time I purchased the tempered glass protector and I am very pleased with it| The screen looks perfectly clear and you don't even realize that there is a screen protector on| The tempered glass may cost a little more| but it is worth it and Zagg always stands by their products|
negtive,2,I left the store with this applied| Because it is glass| it has no flexibility and the surface of the s7 seems to have somewhat rounded edges so it leaves this shield lifted up just a hair on the edges| It cracked EVERY SINGLE TIME the screen hit something in my bag or pocket| ZAGG was great| super warranty but seriously do you want to replace it every week? Go with a ZAGG top of the line screen protector made with military grade components-best screen protector ever!
negtive,3,Normally I swear by Zagg products| I have purchased many Zagg screen protectors| at least 3 Zagg keyboards| and one pair of Zagg earphones| Before now| I would give every product 5 stars| But this screen protector is the first that began peeling up after only 2 weeks| We let the Best Buy employee apply the protector| so perhaps they did something wrong| We have not yet contacted Zagg for a replacement| I expect that their customer service will be excellent as it has been in the past|
positive,5,I dropped my phone and it landed face down on a concrete pad| The screen protector cracked in many places| BUT save my phone screen from even the slightest nick| Way Cool! I went and purchased another one at the store due to not wanting my phone unprotected while waiting on the shipping time| then went through the process of paying $7|00 for shipping to get another protector from ZAGG| I then returned the replacement protector to the store for a credit back to my account|
negtive,3,Zagg glass worked wonderfully on my S5| However| on the S7 the glass doesn't lay flat on the edges| There appears to be a slight curve to the edge of the screen which prevents the Zagg protector from adhering on the sides| I don't know if this will affect the performance of the screen protector| or if it is only a cosmetic problem| Zagg protectors have worked well in the past(for me)| so I'm keeping it on the screen for now| I would recommend Zagg products but not this one for the S7|
negtive,3,I have this protector on my S7| As far as touch and swiping| works fine| No major scratches detected| Problem is there is a halo effect on the outer edge of the screen protector| Quite noticeable at first| but you get use to it| That halo problem becomes another issue when the edge of the protector cracks!!! The phone is fine| but the screen protector is now cracked at the edge| which makes me wonder if the warranty is worth a d**n| Has the screen protector become compromised at this point?
negtive,3,After trying generic glass screen protectors that were terrible| I decided to bite the bullet and get the very expensive ZAGG branded protector| I think the price is far too high compared to their competitors| but I digress| My main quarrel with this protector is that it collects dirt and lint on the edges since the screen is rounded| Not sure if ANY screen protector can full cover the new Galaxy phones| and I find that to be very unfortunate| Otherwise| this protector mostly gets the job done|
negtive,2,I'm on my second one in a month| The first was applied by the BB sales guy on my S7 standard| He said that it would seal on the edges overnight| but that never happened| It cracked within 3 weeks| I used the lifetime warranty and got another from Zagg (had to pay $5 shipping)| I applied the new one and it's the same thing| My guess is that there is a minuscule curve on the edges of the screen and the Zagg glass won't bend to seal|Don't bother with this product|
negtive,3,Best Buy staff put the screen protector on my phone and there were a couple small bubbles| I recently noticed that the screen protector has some large scratches on it| The phone is usually in a pocket in my purse or on the counter| There is nothing in that pocket of my purse where the phone is and there is no zipper on that pocket (it is made for a cell phone) and it hasn't fallen or anything to scratch it like that| Not sure how good that fortified tempered glass construction is|
negtive,2,Not to great of a product| 1st you had to pay the price then pay to have a warranty| then it is extra for them to put the glass on the phone| I didn't pay extra to have it placed on on my phone for me as I thought it would be simple to put on|||||||WRONG ANSWER! Now my warranty apparently doesn't cover any of it| Wasted money| like if that is the policy| then please advise your customer| Thanks for the heads up!
negtive,3,There is another review about how this protector doesn't lay against the phone| the edges are lifted| I took a chance and that review is true| I like how the protector is thicker| which provides better protections but since Samsung S7 (not the edge) screens rounds off at the edges| this protector doesn't seal all the way| it'll do for now until i pick up a thinner one that has more flexibility|
positive,5,I bought my new phone and put this on it to protect the screen| Of course I dropped my phone a few times before i got a case that I liked| The glass took the brunt of the drops| This screen did crack after dropping the phone a few times but just around the edge| My phone was perfect though| Zagg honored their warranty and a replacement was quickly sent out to me without a lot of hassle| Now I am back to a perfect phone again| Well worth the price for the lifetime warranty that comes with this|
negtive,1,Zagg usually makes excellent screen protectors| but this one misses the mark| I followed the instructions precisely and on a brand new phone| since this is the auto-recommended screen protector when you buy at best buy| and the edges never adhered| It's also just enough smaller than the phone that there is space between it and the edges of my very typical case| After two weeks of light use| the protector started shattering around the edges|
negtive,1,I have always bought ZAGG and have always loved it| until this item| I never leave reviews either but was so disappointed| I had to warn future consumers| This screen protector doesn't touch the right or left side and is currently just collecting dust| ZAGG says it was "made for the curve of the phone" and it obviously was not| otherwise every review wouldn't be complaining about this| Waste of $40! DO NOT BUY!
negtive,1,I bought this when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 and it had a crack in one of the edges within the first day of just being in my pocket| Since than| the the cracks have spread all along the bottom| and there are chips out of the screen protector all along the edges| They also didn't account for the slight curve of the screen on the S7| and this lets dirt and dust build up along the sides of the screen| For $40| this should have held up way better| very disappointed|
positive,5,I have used this tempered glass screen protectors on all my phones| They really do keep your screen from getting broken| Dropped my phone many times| I have never cracked my phones screen| I have cracked the glass | but never my phones glass| They will replace it through their online site| It's warrantied for life| I have sent the old one back and received a new one for like 4|99 shipping charge only| You only have to send the old one back| so don't throw it away|
negtive,2,I bought this screen protector and after dropping my phone from about 1 ft off the ground| the screen protector cracked| I received my replacement with my lifetime warranty| however the new protector cracked on the edge just from being in my bag| It's nice that you are able to replace it| just having to pay shipping| However| it's quite inconvenient having to go thru the process 2 time in just under 1 month| I'd stick with a screen protector that isn't made of this glass-like plastic|
positive,4,They all broke and cracked| including the last one I had put on my phone| I just feel that for the phone I have| the screen protector should have a little more flexibility| Each time I tried taking the cover off of my phone| the screen protector cracked to pieces| However| this is the best one for my phone| so I just think that because my phone is beveled| not many options are available| I have always used this brand and have had no issues|
negtive,2,The Zagg cover for the Samsung Galaxy S7 is probably Zagg's worst product - ever| It's size is correct| but Zagg didn't seem to anticipate the curved edges of the S7 screen| So| even with a phone case| dust or pocket fuzz will get under the edges of the Zagg glass| Not sure how this will play out long term| but if you want the added comfort to protect your screen| then buy one| If you'd rather send a message to Zagg that this isn't up to their [high set] standard| then don't|
negtive,2,When the shield was applied there was a fine line around the edges that remained dry no matter what we did| It is slowly getting larger| I have registered the product on Zagg and will pursue a replacement| A post found online for this product had similar problem and was noted that some Best Buy stores had an incorrect product for the Samsung Galaxy S7| Hoping for a resolution for replacement from Zagg so althoough it seems like an ok product| no recommendation yet|
negtive,3,The glass is flat but the screen is curved at the edge so the glass does not adhere to the screen edge-to-edge| Any pressure on the side of the glass causes it to lose contact with the screen| This also happened with the case I purchased in the store| It pressed against the side of the glass| I bought a UAG (Urban Armor Gear) case that is rigid around the glass and doesn't touch the screen| I still have a "halo" around the sreen edge| but it disappears when the screen is active|
negtive,3,The screen protector cracked within a week of purchasing and I was not mishandling my phone| Surprised for a product that offers a lifetime guarantee| It's still on my phone and does protect the screen from scratches so haven't bothered returning to get a replacement| Also seems overpriced for what it is (just a thin piece of plastic - seems like it would cost only pennies to produce - the kind of thing used as packaging that you would just throw away)|
positive,4,This is a very pricey cover| especially since it doesn't cover the entire glass like my original| It is also not making good contact on the edge (yes| it is the correct model for my phone)| Best Buy tech warned me that this was normal for the glass| Even so| the glass is very smooth and phone is more responsive than with the original glass I purchased| Overall| it does what it is meant to and haven't had any problems with it|
negtive,1,Had best buy install the glass shield| Had some concern because it is glass but the best buy salesman convinced me it was great| Next day it was cracking on edges| before long the screen was cracking everywhere| Can't return to best buy| tried but "customer service"was so sorry| we don't stand behind our products| go deal with  Zagg| However their return process is ok and let me exchange the glass shield for a plastic one which works great|
positive,5,I'm very happy with this great product| This was highly recommended by our Best Buy Rep| who also gladly and expertly installed it| It offers durable and lasting protection for my iPhone| which is a major investment for me| My wife and family have used this on their phones and this company has stood behind their replacement policies| So Between my family & Best Buy Rep recommendations| it was an easy decision to invest in this extra protection|
negtive,1,Bought yesterday and had it installed by best buy employee| Was told that the edges of protector would adhere overnight| Woke up to use phone and edge of protector cracked from light finger pressure| Will be returning today| Stay away until they make a product that works with the slight screen couture of the s7|
negtive,1,I've used this product before on several phones and it's been fantastic| However| because the edges of the screen on the S7 are slightly curved| and the glass is apparently not| there is a small gap between the two that causes "shadowing" along the edges and after a couple days of light usage the edges will begin to chip away| This not only looks bad but causes a sharp edge that will catch on everything and could cause injured fingers|
negtive,1,The screen does not fit the phone at all| It cracks on the corners easily| I have only had the screen protector for a month and had to replace it once because the corner cracked then cracked across the whole screen| The second on I got the corner cracked and I even have a case on the phone| This product is junk and I would not tell anyone to purchase these| I was a hugh Zagg fan in the past and have always purchased them for my phones but never again|
negtive,3,I have always heard good things about the zagg screen protectors| so I decided to buy one when I got my s7| Worked well for about a week| then I noticed a scratch that went almost down the whole screen| Just from being in my purse| and possibly my keys were against it| Not good for claiming to be "scratch resistant|" I already ordered my warranty replacement screen| If you buy this definitely register it! If this second screen scratches I'm changing brands for sure|
negtive,1,i was super excited about this screen protector| because with the built in water resistance of the Galaxy S7| i knew all i would have to worry about is bumps and scratches| however| after application exactly according to the instructions| the glass peeled up around the edges| it did not conform to the shape of the screen| very disappointing| that said| best buy customer service was excellent and upon seeing why i was dissatisfied| refunded the purchase
negtive,3,The shield worked for a Samsung7 but I have the edge| They stop making them for the Edge so I decided to try one for the 7| It worked but did not protect the EDGE of the phone| It also caused a delay when i touched the screen| Since the shield didnt fit the edges it collected a lot of dirt and looked old| I ended up taking off the shield and getting a flimsy screen protector; which only protects the screen against scratches not drops
negtive,2,The screen protector does not fit the curvature of the phone| There is a halo around the edge of it that attracts dirt and dust particles| Screen protector was damaged when trying to use the Gear VR| Not sure if this was due to dirt under the edge or not| Needed a screen protector at the time| but if I would have known the fit I would have probably choose another protector| The company was supposedly going to make a new protector so it fits properly|
negtive,3,My girlfriend has it on her Samsung galaxy s7 (not edge)| I noticed that I believe because the edges of the phone are slightly curved while the screen is not that the glass is not completely flush with the screen| the other day she said she hit her finger on the screen by accident and she now has a small chip on the very top of the screen protector| it is a good product you just need to be careful with it| I would personally buy the glass curve the next time|
negtive,3,So my favorite part about ZAGG is that they have an awesome warranty setup| Seems in part because they really need to| The protectors work| but they are fragile and sometimes don't properly adhere to the device| The adhering to the case is the issue that I experienced where it won't properly adhere to the edges| They're cool about sending another though| so we'll see if the second one has an easier time|
positive,4,I think that this product is a good sense of protection for my new Galaxy S7| but I wish the edges of the screen protector would have stayed adhered to the glass surface| The edges are a bit cloudy due to the protector not staying adhered to the glass| I even paid $7 for Best Buy employees to install the protector| Maybe I will take it back and ask them to fix it| Other than that it is a great product and I feel good about investing in this product|
negtive,1,Don't buy for the S7! I was told how great the Zagg Glass Screen was| Unfortunately| I started seeing cracks along the edges and I hadn't dropped my phone| When I went back to Best Buy (where it was purchased and installed)| I was told that could happen if it was bumped against something| I pushed back and the sales people finally confirmed with the Samsung rep that there was a known defect between the design of the S7 and the design of the Glass Screen|
positive,4,I have used zagg screen protectors and always been happy| Purchased 2 Galaxy's S7's and zagg invisibleshield glass protectors| Within two weeks screen protector was coming loose on one phone and ended up breaking| On both phones the glass protectors does not make contact with the curvature of the phone on the sides of the screen| Luckily one of the phones has a case that covers the sides so screen protector can't catch on anything|
negtive,1,This screen protector is a lot of money for a screen protector| It is not worth buying! The glass does not cover the edges at all! It collects more lint then my dryer can| It is very bad and I am very disappointed! I bought 4 screen protectors from zagg prior to this one| They all fit great! This one does not fit well| Find another screen protector this one will make your phone ugly|
positive,5,This was a lifesaver for my wife! She got a cracked screen from a student at her school she works at and so after she got the screen replaced she bought this product and the same thing happened again except this time the Zagg cracked and not the screen! You got a full replacement on the screen protector and she's back in business! I recommend this to anyone who needs extra protection on their phone screen!
negtive,1,I purchased the glass screen as a recommendation from the sales associate| Paid the $8 to have him put it on| Within two weeks| it is peeling off and the edges have splintered and cracked in three different places| I hope Zagg will stand behind their warranty| but I also hope Best Buy will take accountability for a poor placement on the phone as well| Not worth paying for the glass| I never had issues with the plastic shield for 3 years|
positive,4,There's been no noticeable decrease in touch sensitivity after applying the thick protector| And it is THICK| so unless you go at it with a saw| you're not going to scratch the screen underneath|The only imperfection is around the edges| The S7 (not the Edge version) still has a slight slope around its edges| which this protector will not adhere to| This leaves a small amount of room for dust or lint to get in there and get stuck to the adhesive|
negtive,1,I had a Zagg glass protector for my Galaxy S5 and it served me well saving my phone many times| When I upgraded to the S7 Edge I quickly bought this Zagg screen protector| The edges keep peeling; the included activator doesn't hold the protector's edges; the protector is so thin that it is pretty much impossible to squeeze out all the air bubbles| It's like cutting a piece of Saran or Glad Wrap and sticking it on the phone's screen|
negtive,3,This screen protector is 85% great| Even though I have the standard S7| there is a small curve on each side built into the screen| This screen protector does not match this contour| so there are strips on each side of the screen without the screen protector adhering| So far| I have not had an issue getting buildup under these edges| but there is a color difference between where the screen protector touches and does not touch the screen|
negtive,2,I bought two new phones and this Zagg product for each phone| Now three months later both Zagg screens are toast| One has a crack running from top to bottom of the screen| The other has several fractures that started at the edge of the screen and spread into the center| I know that my phone (one of the two phones) has never been dropped| In addition| it is in an Otter case for safety| Yet the Zagg shield is cracked from top to bottom|
positive,4,I tried another glass screen protector and the fit was terrible|||it didn't fit the edges and started peeling off from the top edges from the start| Had to replace within 3 months| This screen protector sticks to screen|||but the entire rim looks like it has a uniform amount of air under it although besides for getting dust under it| it's still a better fit for an ill designed screen on the S7|
positive,5,I was warned the edges of the glass would lift and it would be annoying| I can see a lifted edge on my protector probably measuring 3 millimeters| It doesn't bother me at all The screen is equally as clear with the glass| it is equally as sensitive as without and I am happy with this product| I love that if the company comes out with a new Zagg cover that does not lift at the edges| I will be able to replace it with the new one|
negtive,1,I paid $7|99 for someone at Best Buy to put it on and $29|99 for the product| After two days it started to crack along the edges| I went back to Best Buy and due to the flu I didn't get there within the time frame so they had me call the company| The company was wonderful and sent me a new glass shield free of charge| The shield on my old phone is in perfect condition after 3 years but it is plastic| not tempered glass|
positive,5,This is the first time I went with this type of screen protector| So far so good| I am glad the company offers life time warranty| I upgraded 2 phones that day and decided that better quality accessories are worth a try| We registered the protector immediately after the purchase and hope to never use the warranty| but with teenagers and busy life styles something tells me we will eventually :)
positive,4,Have had this for a few months now| so far no cracks except for a small chip in the top corner where my phone landed (in an otterbox case as well) I do like the sensitivity it provides| however| the Samsung S7 has a slightly curved screen| so dont expect this to reach the edges (sides)| mine is a little less than 1/8 inch down the sides from making contact w the factory glass|Still well worth it if you can get it on sale|
positive,5,I have used Zagg Shields for many years| I have always had great luck with their product| Being a very busy person and often grabbing up a pile of things and heading out the door is common for me| This can cause problems when it comes to protecting the screen of your cell phone| I have dropped my phone countless times from carpet to concrete floors| Throughout these my screen has been saved by the Zagg shield|
negtive,3,You buy this when want to be sure your screen is protected and never want to buy another screen protector| This one has a lifetime warranty|On the downside| the edges of my phone screen are rounded| so this protector doesn't fit perfectly and dust tends to collect under the sides| It's also very expensive| but that's why there's a warranty| I have also heard that it does its job well| being the thing that cracks instead of your screen|
positive,4,I was told this provides better protection on my screen| I assume it has but it is cracked in 4 different places| I feel like I haven't been rough with it and the cracks have all come on different days| My phone is really only about a month old| That being said| the protector is cracked| but my real screen is protected and that is was it is designed to do|||||protect||||||I also like how easy it is to get a warrantied replacement|
negtive,3,The Galaxy S7 has an uneven front screen around the edges of the phone and I have been through 3 of these glass screens already because they start cracking from the outside in| I've got to take this one off| because it is cracking from the outside corner again| I think I am going to try the plastic instead of the glass| Never had a problem with the glass screens before| I actually prefer them| just not for the S7|
negtive,3,I bought this glass screen protector and it crack the screen protector 2 days later| It looked like my screen was cracked| But they have unlimited replacement warrenty through zagg company| So that was great| My BF also bought the same glass proctector and it cracked on him as well| He replaced it and it cracked again| Its clear on the screen| Your phone is protector | Just hopefully we dont have to keep replaceing the screen protectors|
negtive,3,Bought this product based on good experience with Zagg glass covers fro my S7| Unfortunately the sides of the screen curve a little bit and the cover will not adhere there| I keep my phone in a case| so other than it being a cosmetic issue| it has caused me no problems| No edge cracking yet| I would NOT use this cover without at case though| Zagg needs to find a fix and not just say to use a worthless polymer screen cover|
positive,4,Thick enough to prevent the screen from cracking and instead cracks itself if necessary| But it does have a life time warranty that is a bit of a head ache to get a new 1 if it does break| Better than the cheep screen protectors though| Gave it a 4 due to the halo effects it has on my s7 (not the edge)| Mainly shows when the phone is off or dark| I can bairly see it while using the phone| Overall| the product servers it purpose!
positive,5,My little girl loves to carry around my phone and even though its a glass screen protector it still works extremely well| I had a co worker that couldnt understand why i have it| I promptly picked my phone up and dropped it on the cement floor| She gasped loudly and when she saw there was no damage done to my phone i gave her a thats why look| I love not having to worry about my screen getting shattered if my phone is dropped|
positive,5,Hands down the best product in this category| Zagg has been continuously perfecting their craft since the beginning| They don't interfere with cases and you hardly notice they are installed| But| they add the highest level of protection for your screen| When ever I take it off| the screen looks brand new| They also have great customer service and provide replacements as part of the warranty|
negtive,2,First zagg screen I've bought that I'm not satisfied with| They didn't make this to fit the slightly curved screen edges on the Galaxy S7| so it just cracks| It's holding up ok where it does fit flush| and I've dropped my phone with no damage| But it has cracks where it's not flush and I have a feeling it will continue to crack until I have to replace the whole thing| Hopefully they make another one to fix this issue|
negtive,2,This screen protector was selected by the sales associate| and as stated on the package by the manufacturer| is for the Galaxy s7| It protects well and feels smooth with no bubbles|||sort of| The edges of this screen cover do not exactly fit the edges of the s7 (not the s7 edge) and its works fine but it is slightly disappointing| I think that Zagg has since released a new one and admitted that Opps this didn't quite fit|
positive,4,I upgraded to a Galaxy S7| three weeks later I went to California to visit family| We went on a tour and as I was leaving the bus I dropped my phone face down and the screen cracked| I never cracked a screen before| So with much paranoia and many reviews I decided to purchase this to protect my phone| So far it's great| I can rest know that my screen is protected and this protector has a lifetime guarantee|
negtive,3,I've had this same screen protector for my past phones and loved it| The ONLY thing that I don't like about this one for the Galaxy S7 is that the sides don't completely adhere to the phone| About 4mm not sticking to the phone|||as if the phone is beveled| So| when grabbing my phone with another item in my hand| the part not adhered cracked| Still better protection than without it|||and it offers keeping great sensitivity for touch|
negtive,3,The screen protector seems to hold up against drops and scratches| Although it does not lay flat on the new Samsung S7's screen| I am guessing due to being tempered glass it will not contour to the bend in the cell phone's screen| This bit of room leaves an error in space for dirt| lint and dust to get under the edge of the protector and I am sure over time will cause the adhesive of the protector to stop working|
negtive,1,This is an exceptional product| Ithe redefine the next level of screen protector| Aside from protecting the screen it'seems easy on the eyes and finger motion|However| the installation was horrible| The wait time was long plus the installer left an hair between the screen protector and the my cell| Never advise if I can return to get it fixed|Will not return to this particular best buy and any recommendation!!!
negtive,3,The Samsung S7 (standard model) has a slight curve on the edges of the screen| It is not a dramatic curve like the Samsung S7 Edge| The Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 leaves about 1 centimeter on each side (left and right) that does not adhere to the screen| The screen still functions but eventually the gap under the screen protector is going to fill with dust and lint|
positive,4,This is a must for any phone I feel| It gives you extra protection for your screen| I have seen so many phones with the screens shattered because of a simple drop and you can't even use the phone other than answering a call|| The extra protector saves the phone just in case it hits the floor| Phones are so expensive these days and I can't afford to replace them so the protection I get from the protector is so worth it|
positive,4,I had a great experience with Zagg screen protectors in the past| they honor the warranty and customer service is excellent| This specific product has a design flaw and the edges do not follow the slight curvature of the screen| so it stays up preventing a perfect fit| The level of protection though is still amazing| I'm still a Zagg glass customer| but the issue on the edges is the only complain|
negtive,3,I have had InvisibleShield protectors for other phones and know that they will replace the protector is it gets damaged| The cons for this one is that with the Galaxy S7| you will end up with a border on the screen| Customer support said that it is due to the S7 screen being beveled slightly| Also| around the border| I have to press harder for the phone to recognize my touch|
negtive,1,Although stating that it is for the Galaxy S7| it does not come close to fitting the phone| Why a company would make a flat piece of glass to protect a CURVED screen I don't know| Why a Best Buy associate would sell this product is also puzzling| Very unsatisfied| complete waste of time and money! Gave it a single star only because at least one star was required|
negtive,3,I have only had the protector on my phone for over a month and it's already cracke| I haven't had any major drops with my phone| I thought this product was supposed to be shatterproof|||I have had other protectors on my phones and tablets that seemed to be able to withstand small drops without scratching| chipping or cracking| I will definitely be replacing this product through the lifetime warranty in the near future|
negtive,2,I have had TWO of these things crack and break on me| and not from falling or being struck or anything| Just taking it out of my pocket and there is damage to the sides and once there is one crack like anything glass it just cracks more and more over time|Zagg's lifetime warranty is free but you have to pay a minimum of $6 for shipping and I don't want to pay $6 every two months for a screen protector!
negtive,3,The Zagg Glass Screen protector may turn out to be a wonderful protective product| But right now I have to rate it so-so| The reason is that despite the store installing it| there is still an edge that did not adhere fully| The store said that was normal| that despite their best efforts there is usually one corner edge that does that| Given how expensive this product is| that is most frustrating|
positive,5,The glass screen protectors are the best| I have a big dog who loves to jump up and hug you and he's knocked my phone out my hands so many times| he's even hit the screen with his claws| Let me tell you I've had to replace my protector at least 4 times cause it's cracked|||but my s tual phone screen is fine| the glass zagg protector absorbs all the damage so your phone screen doesn't|
negtive,1,Worst screen protector I've ever owned| Day 2 of having it on my new phone| I already started noticing little cracks around the edge of the protector| A week later| my son accidentally dropped a set of keys on top of it and cracked the entire protector and part of my screen! At $40| I would expect better protection than that| I will never purchase another one of these|
positive,5,Before I had children| I never needed any sort of glass shield product for my phone| Ever since having little ones| my phone is constantly dropped and this is the best option for it| Despite all the drops my glass has NEVER been broken| If you get the warranty with ZAGG ( in which a Best Buy agent hinted I should get) they will send you a new one whenever the old one gets to broken up|
positive,5,This was a replacement purchase| My first screen protector lasted almost three years|but dropping repeatedly caused a crack|which didn't have any effect on the phone| There was a recent ding as well|so decided to replace|just to be safe| This one is working well|and I'm trying to be more careful|too!
positive,5,Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 was an upgrade from an regular plastic feeling screen protector| The upgrade was suggested by an employee who asked me to feel the difference from my old cell phone to his cell phone that that the glass protector on it| I purchased the Zagg - invisibleShied glass screen protector for the new Samsung S7| The feel of the glass protector is solid|
positive,5,This screen protector was recommended by the sales associate| I liked the idea of the glass versus plastic| and the lifetime replacement warranty| The clarity is fantastic| and I'm pleased with it so far| I have only had the phone| etc| about a month| so haven't really "tested" the limit of the protection as far as dropping and screen breaking but the protection from scratches and daily usage seems very good|
negtive,1,Cracked not too long after I got it| I was too lazy to swap it out| Had it for less than a year now it's so cracked up and chunks missing| The edges did not stick down properly (yes I cleaned the heck out it first)| Terrible product| I have a decent case on my phone so there's no reason for it to have gotten as cracked up as it is from accidental drops|
positive,4,I bought this Zagg screen protector for my cell phone| It does what it is supposed to do|||protect your screen from scratches| It is a thicker adhesive plastic| but a pain to try to put on the phone yourself|||the staff at Best Buy will put it on your phone for you|||but BEWARE|||there is an ADDITIONAL $8|00 CHARGE for the Best Buy staff to put the screen protector on your phone!
negtive,1,I decided to save the $7|99 cost to have Best Buy install this screen protector| BIG MISTAKE! The instructions were so confusing| and by the time I got the screen placed correctly on my phone| there were finger prints at the bottom that would never come out| Money totally wasted| I have installed other brands with no problem| But if you buy this brand at Best Buy| let them install it! Lesson learned|
positive,5,Zagg does it - my previous screen OB protector had chipped| then cracked| and I needed to replace| Best Buy will even price-match to Amazon! Easy to follow instructions for install| Also has lifetime warranty| should (when) it cracks - just register on Zagg website| Note: the glass doesn't fully adhere to the slightly tapered edges of my Samsung Galaxy S7| but hasn't caused any issues| Very satisfied|
negtive,1,Because it's glass and the edges of the phone are beveled| the edges of the screen protector don't adhere to the screen leaving a 2mm gap all the way around| I had the plastic version in my hand and the sales girl talked me into getting this one instead because glass is so much better| So I trusted her and spent more money on a protector that I had to remove and throw away| Total waste of money|
negtive,3,Seemed like a good idea at the time| buying something to protect such an expensive phone| Within a week of having it in place| it had shattered along the edge of the camera after sharing my pocket with a golf tee| It since has cracked in a few other areas along the edge| The phone itself remains usable and and the screen itself seems undamaged| but aesthetically it doesn't look great|
negtive,2,Had this screen about a week before it crackes on the side of my s7 (not even an edge S7)| A month later it cracked again| I signed up for the lifetime warranty but it costs $8 for them to send a new and it costs to hace Best Buy put it on|||some lifetime warranty| I feel like it protecta my screen well because it is so thick but my fingers are taking a beating from the cracks||
positive,4,The thought of a glass screen over a plastic one sounded like a great idea since mine was damaged by keys in the same pocket| The glass is very good to look at| There's only one flaw| transferring of pressure from your finger to the real screen isn't perfect| That can be annoying| Other than that I'm happy with this product|
negtive,1,I bought this product at the same time that I got my phone because of the risks of dropping it| I guess it serves its purpose for now| The sides of the glass don't stay adhered to the screen because of the screens slight curve| So I'm sure eventually something will catch one of the raised sides of the glass and either break it or pull it off the phone| Don't waste your 40 or so dollars on this|
negtive,1,I have used Zagg since 2006 on all of my mobile devices and have throughly enjoyed the quality| While I understand that as of now no glass screen protector will fully fit the curve of the S7 why would you sell this product| I am waiting for the release of the new curved glass from Zagg just not happy with the quality and decision to release an inadequate product|
negtive,1,I love Zagg| have for a long time| But this one really fell short| The edges don't lay down because of the slight curve to the phone| It messes up the screen and looks down right awful| For the price| I'm angry| I emailed customer support through Zagg and they essentially shrugged me off| Don't waste your money or time!
negtive,1,I've never been known to break a screen| so I just wanted to get a regular screen protector| Unfortunately| they only had these $40 glass protectors| but I figured I would never have to buy another protector| Boy was I wrong! It started cracking in two spots around the edge the day after I bought it||| (I never once dropped it to cause it to crack) I will not be purchasing this product again|
negtive,1,Do to the edges not making contact with the screen the protector cracks on the edges| it cracked the day after it was installed| This has happened on mine and my wife's phones| We are very careful with our phones and they are always in perfect condition when we trade them in| I am waiting for the Zagg new curved lens cover| I hope it is replaced with no issues|
negtive,1,I used to trust ZAGG products| But after this one| I would not buy another ZAGG product for Samsung| See my photo| The gap is very noticeable on my S7| worse than on my Note 4| There is another one supposed to correct this problem but it's only sold on ZAGG's website at higher price|
positive,5,Any time one uses a cell phone it can become abundantly smudged with fingerprints from texting and all other kinds of air contaminants and debris during a normal daily usage| These types of soilings aren't easily removed| but with a invisible glass shield they can be removed from the screen easier and the brilliance can be returned to the viewing area much better than if the shield weren't present|
negtive,3,I bought this thinking it was the new glass protecter for the S7| It isn't| So far| ZAGG doesn't make a glass screen protecter for this device| The one that they did have| which I bought| doesn't adhere around the perimeter of the phone| It does provide protection but won't look right and will get dirt and small particles under the screen| I would suggest you get another kind that fits|
negtive,1,This screen protector forms a halo around it| It appears as if it was lifted and after a while it started cracking from one side and then from another side| Given that they come with a warranty I will be contacting ZAGG to get a replacement but I would give it some time in oder for them to fix this issue| I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it right now| Give it some time until ZAGG fixes this problem|
positive,4,I have always liked Zagg screen protectors but the fit on the Galaxy S7 leaves a little halo on the edges because of the phone design| Dirt and lint from my pockets have started to collect under the sides making it a short lived protector if that kind of thing bothers you| The durability on the other hand is fantastic| the glass screen protectors make me feel much more at ease about accidents|
negtive,2,I always get Zagg screen protectors for my phones as they usually don't disappoint| However this one could definitely be better| There's a Halo around the edges of my screen protector due to the S7's slight curve near the edges (I have a regular S7 and not a S7 Edge and there is still a slight curve on the sides of the regular S7)| With the halo showing| dirt will build up under the screen protector|
negtive,1,This item is horrible| Zagg and Bestbuy sell an item THEY KNOW isn't going to fit the phone| Why this item hasn't been taken off the selling floor is beyond me| AFTER you buy it they tell you it doesn't fit the phone right|||well if you know that then get rid of it| My cover cracked days after getting it because the cover is flat and the phone is slightly curved at the edges|
negtive,1,I am a huge fan of Zagg shields for most every phone I've ever owned| Unfortunately| it does not fit the S7 properly| Due to the slight curvature of the S7 screen the screen protector does not adhere solidly around the edges and leaves what they call a halo effect| This effect really bothers me and it's hard because it leaves a different color than the rest of the screen protector|
positive,5,I've used Zagg products for years and can't say enough good about them| Their support and lifetime replacement policy is outstanding| If the protective cover cracks| gets scratched| etc| you go online or call and they ship a replacement (always had mine within 3 days) for only the minimal shipping cost| Put the new one on and send them back the damaged one in the provided postage paid envelope|
negtive,1,Liked the touch and feel of the glass shield protector| however with the S7 (not the edge)| the edge of the screen is still slightly beveled| This protector doesn't account for that design and per best buy personnel a known issue| Eventually returned the item as there was a halo effect around the perimeter which eventually collected pocket lint and obscured some of the viewing screen|
negtive,3,We didn't notice it at first but after using the glass shield for a while| we noticed there was a sensitivity issue when trying to use certain numbers or letters on the keyboard while texting| This really bothers me b/c I consider myself to text fairly fast and the issues causes me to have to go back and correct a lot before actually sending the text|
positive,4,Love the glass screen it's worth paying Best Buy a few dollars extra to put it on properly my screen is clean and smooth definitely worth the money to protect my screen too many people have broken their screens just make sure you register your screen we use the OtterBox case and put the glass screen on it best protection no problems can hear clearly it's wonderful definitely highly recommend
negtive,2,I don't care about the lifetime warranty| I'm more worried about the fact that it does not sit flush on the left and right side like others have stated| Big $40 disappointment| I bought Zagg instead of a cheap Amazon generic for a reason| and I was let down|
negtive,3,It was easy to put on| and it has stayed on with no issues| It is very clear| and cleans up easy with a microfiber cloth| The only thing that I didn't like is that there is a space around the edge of it|On both the right and left sides| there is a 3/8" or so area where the protector is not on the phone which leaves a noticeable strip on both sides| Other than that| it has worked good|
negtive,2,The shield itself is great but my daughter broker hers less than a week afterward|||||you have to go on line| enter the warranty info| mail the broken on it (you remove it yourself)| send $$ for shipping and handling and then about a week later it shows up in the mail| Then you can install it yourself or go back to the store| where| the will install it for free|||| Wheeeeeee| what a deal|
negtive,1,This screen protector does not fit correctly on the galaxy s7| The screen edge on the galaxy phone is curved just enough to leave a noticable bubble around the entire edge of the phone| It does not adhere to the phone completely| It has been installed for a couple weeks now and the bubbles have not gone away| I would not recommend purchasing this screen protector|
positive,5,I can honestly say that this product is worth the money!! I have put the Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector on all of our phones! I know from experience that they work - after accidently dropping my phone the shield cracked - which is replaced for free when you reach out to the company - but it saved my phone - and now that we have to lease phones the Zagg protector is a must!!
negtive,3,I had it on my S5 and it was great| so I decided to put it on my S7 and it doesn't sit flush on the sides| I don't like how it looks but I have kids so what can I do| Plus I'm not sure it's the phone or the shield but my buttons are less sensitive to the touch| So I would recommend if you don't mind it not sitting flush and having kids but if your not going to drop your phone don't get it|
negtive,3,Had it installed for two weeks and it's already saved the phone| My wife dropped her phone and the screen protector took the hit and broke instead of the screen| The "lifetime warranty" is a complete pain in the behind though| Almost as cheap to go buy a new protector after all the shipping| I've definitely seen less expensive options out there| Still better than $599 for a new phone though|
negtive,2,Had this product installed when I upgraded my phone| It didn't seal all the way to the edge of the screen| I was told to register for the warranty and then go thru the company to have it replaced for "free"| Have tried a second one with the same issue | Not really a free replacement if I have to pay $5|99 shipping each time| Haven’t decided if I'll try one more or just go my money back|
negtive,1,They should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this| It doesn't fit the slightly rounded screen of the S7 and I guarantee you they don't have one that fits the edge| Within 24 hours the edge of my screen protector was cracked| Zaggs fix to this problem was to send me a cheap screen protector| They have no idea when the screen protector that fits the phone properly will be released|
positive,5,This is the best protection for a phone ever| I had one on my previous phone| I dropped the phone one night while I was getting our of my car| It hit the ground face down| I couldn't see it so I ended up stepping on it and slide on it across the concrete| My actual screen was saved! The shield had to be replaced but all I had to pay was S&H since I registered my product| Super pleased!!!!!
positive,5,The original shield protected my phone when it fell on concrete| It cracked and the company offers a life-time replacement| I bought this to put on my phone while waiting to get the replacement shield| It came fast| and should I break it again| I will have one to put right on while getting another replacement| Best Buy put it on my phone for me too|
negtive,2,Very disappointed| Previous protector lasted over 2 years with barely a scratch| Within 1 week| this had a sizeable crack across one corner from picking it up by the corner| Will be taking advantage of the replacement program| Hopefully that will go smoothly and next one well be better as these are rather expensive to have to deal with poor quality| My husband's has been good so far|
negtive,2,This Screen Protector cracked only 3 after I purchased the item and it cost 6 or 7 dollars to ship the replacement and then you have to pay to ship the bad one back| The last one I got took nearly 18 months to crack| when they crack they are usually hard to see unless they are in just the right light| even with a cracked screen protector you are still able to do almost everything
positive,5,This is the best screen protector if you are a phone dropper| With young kids around my phone and accidents happen I have never had a cracked screen| The glass cracks if it hits right but you just peel it off and replace it and the actual phone screen underneath is fine| I highly recommend this product|
negtive,2,Best Buy charges $8 to place it on my phone| Seriously??Placed it on my brand new phone| Even though they used the rubber/silicone squeegee it still has air bubbles under it in several places| It's already chipped on the edge| Less than a month old|Worst screen protector I've purchased and at least double the price of any I've ever purchased| I'm not pleased at all|
positive,4,The salesmen did mention and show me the fit of the Zagg glass on the S7 and while it does not fit flat against the display| I am hoping that it does not affect wear| although it is a reason for concern| I only purchased it 4 days ago| so no issues as of yet| I was not offered an alternative| so I went with it hoping for the best| as I was very happy with the Zagg glass for my S5|
positive,5,Been using these for years and have broken two of them| but the screen is perfectly fine| Saves me $110 repair costs every time I break one| Their offer of sending you a replacement cover if it breaks is incredible| For cost of shipping and handing| you get a brand new one| Be sure to ask BB to price match as you will find it cheaper elsewhere| But BB will match it|
negtive,1,Like everyone else said| I purchased this today after getting my phone early from AT&T and the glass doesn't fit the phone| It looks and feels great in the middle| but there is definitely a halo around the edge of the phone due to the curved edge on the S7|
negtive,3,We are longtime zagg buyers but for some reason| which apparently is common| the glass screen for the galaxy s7 does not fit very well| The edges do not lay flat| on both sides the edges are sligtly lifted up and not completely on the phone| Otherwise| I love using the zagg glass screen protector but I think samsung tweaked the phone a little too much with a curve|
positive,4,The screen protector works as expected and advertised| not only does it protect| but it seems to to enhance the screen color and clarity| My only challenge was getting a perfectly clean screen so the protector went on without specs on the screen| I have 2 specs of dust on my screen that I cannot see when the phone is on| but you can tell it's there was a black screen|
positive,5,This Glass Screen Protector has saved me several times! I happened to enter and see a customers broken phone| A Rep| pulled the top piece off and the phone was UNBROKEN! Within a few weeks I dropped my phone and saw cracks everywhere| After pulling off the protector|||||| MY phone was perfect! NOT ONE Crack! I immediately went and replaced the shield| I will not be without one!
positive,5,Good cover| easy application| In my opinion SUPER expensive| but was convenient to get it right at the store (versus online)| If you're looking to save cash| think ahead and order ahead| But| in this case| I'd say you get what you pay for| I use a case that doesn't have a screen protector| but no screen problems from normal use or dropping here and there thanks to this product|
negtive,1,All was well| until the screen protector wouldn't set properly| I expected a lot from this| especially because it was so pricey and was recommended by a friend| I did everything exactly as the instructions said| The protector just doesn't fit the phone :c !
negtive,3,At first I was told that the edges would settle to the curvature of the screen| That did not happen| With a little checking I found out that zagg| for whatever reason| was not aware of precise specs for the S7 phone| Zagg has announced a new "curved" screen for the S7 on their website to be available soon| but they don't know exactly when|
negtive,1,This is my second screen protector first replaced free by Best Buy for same reason pulling sway from the screen on all 4 corners & now up the sides| I have a case on my phone also| I have searched & can't find any other screen protectors for the S7 Edge| DO NOT PURCHASE! YOU DO NOT GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR EVEN THE SCEOND TIME AROUND!
negtive,3,At worst the screen protector has already cracked within about 2 weeks time from light pressure on the phone between being in my pocket or lightly rolled over on in bed which ends up getting moved to the night table after that realization| its meh at best and I was upsold on it and didnt realize it till I left the store as the case I bought had a screen protector in it
positive,5,I would never buy a phone again with one of these screen protectors| I had my new S7 for two weeks and dropped it one time the case I had didn't help at all the screen protector cracked but the phone screen was unharmed| I took it to a Zagg kiosk all the mall and they changed it out in just minutes| No question asked| Although it cost me me $16|00 to get the new one installed|
positive,4,Best Buy installed the shield for me| Zagg has a great warranty which sells my use| The shield looks good| Went on very well| Only negative thing that may or may not be the shield| seems like the screen may not be quite as sensitive to swipes as the older flexible film| It may be just me but that is the only concern I would have| Swipes work| just not always on the first time|
negtive,1,I was disappointed in this screen cover| It cracked in two places before I had it for two weeks| Best Buy said they were getting a lot of the covers in that were warped which in turn caused cracking| After contacting Zagg they are sending a new one| but wanted to charge a $5|99 shipping fee| I talked them into waving it this time since it was a defective screen cover|
negtive,2,Not crazy about how the screen protector fits the screen||||has a halo effect all on both sides and makes the screen less sensitive|The first one I had cracked on the edge||||the one the store tried to n put on my husband phone cracked as they were putting it on|||||Not very happy with the over all look and use of the protector| I would not buy this again
positive,5,This is my second time purchasing this product it totally protected my screen when my kid dropped phone on the bus and I didn't want to wait for mail shipment so I repurchased it|The cover cracked as if it was glass and my child was scared to show me phone when he came home but all was well screen protector worked as advertised|
negtive,2,Top right corner of shield separated from screen surface on 1st install by Best Buy associate| I returned for credit under 14-day warranty and another BB associate installed 2nd one which is now having the same problem but in both top corners where it curves around the center cutout| Twice makes me think it is defective design| Plan to consult BB again|
negtive,1,With this installed on an S7 you cannot use anything near the edge of the screen due to the fact that it doesn't conform to the slight curve of the phones edges| No I don't have the "curve" version of the phone|I don't usually do negative reviews| but this product does not work for the phone it is sold for|
negtive,3,I have had Zagg screen protectors on my phones in the past| It is a great product| However though it was listed to fit my Samsung it was too wide and hung slightly over the edges| This was not just one screen protector but the same for the other two that I bought for the other new phones that I bought| Best buy was willing to take all 3 back if I was disatisfied|
positive,4,The screen protector does what it is supposed to do| HOwever| on the Samsung S7 it does not fit the edges of the phone well and does not adhere well| This is not the EDGE phone| but the regular phone| There is also a charge to ship it and to install it| Total cost is about $13 to replace the class screen| Zagg customer service is GREAT however|
positive,4,$40 for the screen protector and another $8 to have it installed seemed a bit high| When other places will put the screen on for free| But in the long run its a good investment on a $700 phone| It does not effect using the phone and you can't even tell its there| My only suggestion would be for the screen to attach on the edges| Dirt gets trapped there easily|
negtive,1,I've had zagg glass protectors before and they worked great (though I had undesirable warranty customer service from zagg) but they are not for the S7's curved screen| I was warned about the "halo effect" and that the edges might crack a bit| but that happened after I'd had it 2 days and had not dropped it| I ended up with cracks all across my screen with no origin points|
negtive,2,I have not had any problems with the screen protector| but had I read the reviews| I would have bought a different one| The S7 (basic model) has a slight curve on the edge of the screen| This glass screen protector is completely flat and does not cover the curved edges| I bought this in-store and did not think to read online reviews while shopping|
negtive,3,I have had these on my last 2 phones and they fit really well| and did an amazing job at protecting the screen| I upgraded all of our phones to S7s and have had to replace 3 of these already| in just over 1 month| They don't fit well| where the edges on either side of the phone don't actually sit against the screen| Pretty poor for the S7|||unfortunate|
positive,5,Work outside| so was looking for more protection for my screen| Had one with the last phone and wanted to continue that| One suggestion| if you buy the Otter protective case for your phone| there is also a screen protector in the box| so you don't have to buy a separate one like this| This screen protector is good| but just sayin' | | | |
negtive,1,Zagg makes great screen protectors and I used theirs on my S5 for 2 years| But somehow with the new design of S7| the curved edges| etc| the screen protector gives a very poor tactile experience| I was doubting the quality of the phone but realized that it was the screen protector which was messing up my interactions rather than the phone itself|
negtive,1,4 mm halo around the entire screen| had the sales associate apply and she tried 2 and they were both the same| seriously annoying because it was the same with the s6 until they recut the glass after customer complaints| why did I assume that the s6 ill-fitting screen was an isolated error? would leave no star if I could|
negtive,1,I bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S7 phone| I did NOT buy the Galaxy S7 Edge| However| the new S7 screens are still slightly curved at the edges| Zagg did not compensate for the slight imperceptible curvature of the new phone screens| As a result| the edges of the Invisibleshield Glass do not adhere to the screen| Don't buy until they fix the problem|
negtive,3,this shield does not fit properly| it is a good enough protector to use until zagg comes out with a newer one that fit the screen better| it seems that the new galaxy s7 phones have a bit of a lift on the edges and this glass protector does not conform to the lift| per a zagg rep|| the new shields coming out soon should be able to conform better to the phones|
positive,4,This is actually the second GlassShield I've purchased for the same phone since it was purchased about 8 months ago| I had radiating cracks in two to three spots on the shield and decided to replace it before it got worse| However| it did its job in that the actual glass on the phone screen is still pristine| Hoping this second one lasts a little longer|
positive,5,I am a dropper| I drop my phone at least once a week| I put this screen saver on when I purchased my phone and it protected the screen as it said it would| The glass protector cracked in several places (instead of the actual phone screen cracking)| Still worked when cracked|
negtive,3,I got this and I'm not sure if it was a good purchase| I may be saving my screen from scratches but the sides of the protective layer doesn't reach all of the screen and there are cracks in it| I now have to research on how to get it replaced| Not even a full year and I'm not that much of a hard user of my phone|
negtive,3,Covers most of the screen side of the phone and protects it from damage| Dropped my phone once and the protector cracked slightly but the phone is fine| Has a border that looks like the protector isnt making contact with the screen| Not sure if its suposed to do this it all the way around| Looks weird| But it still provides protections so i deal with it|
negtive,3,The thin glass does cove the whole are of the phone| However| as the screen of the Galaxy S7 has a slight curve on the edges| the glass cover does not bend with it| As a result the edges of the screen are not glue to the glass| When the screen is on| it makes no difference| But you can see it when the screen is off| Still| it does protect your phone|
positive,4,I had this product on my Galaxy S4 and it worked great| On my s7| It feels like my touch response is impeded| The touch is not responsive without multiple tapping| Now| my phone just completed an update and this issue may be resolved| Quite frankly| I have not had the opportunity to test it| All in all| however| it does a good job of protecting the screen|
positive,4,The screen protector is better than other Zagg products I have had| The glass is slick and feels like the screen on the phone itself| I got the S7 when it first came out and this screen protector did not seal along the sides of the phone| where it was slightly curved| I was concerned about the screen protector coming off| It has not and I have had it over 2 months|
negtive,3,This protector does it's job and save the screen from small scratches| although it does not fit the S7 like it should so the " Halo effect is a serious issue| I went through more screen protectors for this phone than ever before| Finally got upset enough i just got tired of wasting money on it I traded the phone in on the new Note8
positive,4,Since the sides of my Samsung Galaxy S7 curve on the sides| I had to return this glass screen protector for a plastic one| I'm very disappointed as I know that the glass screen covers protect much better but you can't curve glass! I gave it a high review because the brand is great and my wife was able to get a glass protector for her screen on her phone|
positive,5,This is a life saver| This is my 2nd time purchasing this item| I would NOT or NEVER purchase anything else except this Samsung Protector| It has protected my phone from a fall from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor| My phone landed on cement outside and phone DID NOT CRACK| Only the protector crack!! Love| love this screen protector|
negtive,2,I do not own the curved S7 but the edges are still slightly curved| The glass sits above the edge so there has been dirt and other little things collecting ever since| Also| dropped my phone day one and the glass protector cracked| I know that's the point but I've never had any type of phone protection break on me so easily|
positive,5,This glass protector fits the screen perfectly and is case friendly| I use it with my Otterbox Commuter series case and there are no issues| Clarity is excellent and it really doesn't hold smudges so it's really easy to clean| I have used cheaper ones on previous phones and there is definitely a positive difference with this| For me was well worth the money|
negtive,2,Best Buy price matched and glad they did| Easy to put on and sensativity is nice| Product breaks easy with short fall to carpet several times| They get you for 10 dollars everytime you replace| I have had better break quality with cheaper glasses| Not worth it|
negtive,2,Doesn't fit properly| Poorly mfg| Tried 6 different covers to no avail| Spoke to factory today|possibly a new version will be available by year end| Or so zagg company said| Best Buy was well aware of the problem but was not able to do anything about it| It would be great if the manufacturing company who made the incorrect design fixed the problem sooner|
negtive,2,The screen protector does not adhere to the left and right edges of my screen| It has already broken along the edges in three places within a month| It has probably protected my screen which is why I gave it 2 stars| It is still under warranty so I'll either get a replacement or refund but it should work better than it has|
positive,4,I needed a screen protector for my S7 and this one was the best one out at the time| It works fine| but the only issue I have with it is that it does not completely cover the screen on the phone| There's still like a quarter of an inch of the screen still exposed| Supposedly Zagg has released another screen protector that covers the entire phone now though|
positive,5,I've had my own Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S6 for two years and it's great| When it came time to upgrade my wife's phone| the clear choice was the Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7|These do a GREAT job protecting the screen and are very sensitive to the touch|Charlie Seymour Jr
positive,5,It sells itself| My concern is the employees| Instead of the employees talking to each| its more professional to greet every customer and not turn their backs and continue their conversation| Please approach the customer and not what has happened last or going to happen that day| Thank you|
negtive,3,I've never bought a glass screen| so i thought it would be neat to try this time| I like it| but the when applying for the first time it small air pockets kept creeping up on both sides of the phone| As i pressed firmly around the edges to seal a small crack appeared| For the most part| I like it with an additional hard case as extra protection|
negtive,2,Okay you're going to buy local buy a Zagg invisishield obviously because they our local company that make a good product usually| With the S7 I hate to say it the edges don't sit down and you have what's called haloing you'll never get a good fit you'll constantly get dirt and grime and hair underneath it| and you will pull it off just get the HDX
negtive,2,The galaxy s7 was designed with a beveled screen and this protector doesn't fit well| The edges don't seal allowing dust and particles to collect around the sides| It's also interferes with the touch features at the edge of the screen due to the poor design| However| it still does the job of protecting the screen and the company does guarantee their product!
positive,5,As usual| Zagg doesn't disappoint| I almost always go with Zagg or Spiegen| This time I needed something quick and didn't want to wait for an order to come in for Spiegen so went with Zagg| Instructions are clear and they include everything you need to put the screen protector on right away| It's held up so far through a couple bangs| Top quality here|
negtive,3,It was easy to attach to the phone| which I really liked| but it doesn't stick very well in the upper corners and is coming off a little more each day| I don't remember dropping my phone but there is a chip in the screen protector and not the actual phone screen so it seemed to do the job| I would've rated it higher if it adhered to the phone better|
negtive,1,I've been buying ZAGG screen protectors since 2012| and this is the only time I've been disappointed|The glass protector doesn't fit the phone correctly and cracks around the edges| Originally I thought it was a one time problem and used ZAGG's lifetime warranty| I got a replacement and the same cracks happened within a few days|
positive,5,This thing has a way better feel than other screen protectors| It is glass and well| feels like glass| Install was a breeze| Took me a couple tries to get it centered| Gotta be really careful if you peel it up to re center| It's glass and will break| Great product for the about the same price as other protectors| And a warranty|
positive,4,Maybe it's just me| but the last 2 I've bought have broke very quickly| I usually never have that problem| Although it is a new phone so I suppose it could be the design of the phone| But the point of the protector is to protect the actual phone screen and it definitely does that| I have not had a phone screen ever crack so that's great!
negtive,3,The glass covers the viewable area of the screen; however| the S7 screen curves slightly on the edges and the Zagg does not seat well as it is flat and does not match the curve of the screen| The gap is easily visible and appears that you didn't smooth out the screen protector on the edge| Not attractive| Great product| great warranty| poor fitment|
positive,5,My son got the galaxy 7 for his birthday two weeks ago| I immediately added an otter box case and a Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector because I know| Well| the Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector already has a crack but the phone screen is completely fine| Thank you Zagg for saving the screen on a brand new Galaxy 7|
positive,5,I've had a smartphone for 8+ years and managed to never break the screen| When I purchased my new phone six weeks ago this was the protector the sales rep suggested| Given my history - I almost didn't buy it| Last week I dropped my phone in a parking lot and the protector shattered but NOT the screen on my phone!! I love this product!
positive,4,Had the protection on my phone and phone in a mophie case dropped it and the screen cracked but not the screen protector due to the angle of the hit the case should have protected it| the protector was replaced by Zagg for about $7 which was about 1/2 of the sale price I paid or about 1/4 normal price| the replacement process was easy|
negtive,1,I'm very familiar with Zagg products and so I didn't bother reading any reviews of this product| BIG MISTAKE!!! This product does not fit the Galaxy S7| It was not made to the dimensions of the screen and therefore will not protect your phone as it should| It will not adhere to any of the edges and will make parts of your screen difficult to interact with|
positive,5,Smooth| clear and a perfect fit| Can't believe the sharpness of my screen| I am always amazed at how great my screen looks| I am a first time glass screen protector user and can't believe that for years I dealt with bubbles and marks on my film screen protectors| If you've never used one before this is a must| I am a firm believer of Zagg products|
negtive,2,The Screen Protector doesn't fully seal along the edges| Which creates a halo along the edges and within 4 days you notice dust inside and it starts to peel off| I registered the product with Zagg and they shipped a cheaper version| wasn't glass| but it covered my whole screen with no problem| Pretty much 40 dollars down the drain|
negtive,1,I bought this screen protector and a day later it already had a crack in it| Didnt drop my phone or anything as i didnt have a casd on it at the time and my phone had no scratches| so i exchanged for a new one and once i took it out of the box i noticed it was cracked in half| Wouldnt waste my money again on this screen protector or brand|
negtive,3,Hard to review| since the glass screen protector cracked like a dinged windshield unexpectedly| I am not aware of dropping it or hitting it with a sharp object| Whatever happened| the phone itself is still sound| which is the purpose of the screen protector| It was expensive| Thank goodness the geeks said I didn't need to worry about replacing it now|
positive,4,The first day of owning my Samsung Galaxy S7 it slid off the desk hitting the keyboard shelf on the way down| I picked it up and my heart stopped| There was what looked like chip on the edge of the screen| Closer examination showed it was the screen protector that had taken the damage| So glad they installed it in-store at Best Buy!
positive,5,The Zagg Invisible Glass Screen Protector provides excellent screen protection for our cell phones| We've used them on 3 different phone styles| and each style has a perfect fit| We've also had to replace a couple of the screens and had NO issues with the company| The screens were replaced quickly and simply| A terrific product!
negtive,2,I have had the screen protector on my phone for a little over a month| and there is already a small nick in it| Hasn't been dropped at all| I do sometimes have it in my purse with my wallet| keys etc||| Itsr eally small| can barely see it| I noticed because I felt something rough on the screen while wiping it off| Going to call about the warranty
positive,5,If you are getting a new phone get one of these immediately| You will regret not buying one if you drop the phone often| which is inevitable| Works great so far and I have dropped it several times| No cracks or breaks so far| Note I am also using a smaller otterbox case| Both items coupled together act as a great deterrent to breaks|
positive,4,Bought this on recommendation of Best Buy phone seller guy| It has taken a beating and has protected my new phone very well| It also has fantastic rodent resistance| as my guinea pig was nibbling on it and did not damage it| It does have dust around the edges between the shield and the screen - presumably because the screen curves slightly|
negtive,2,I bought this screen protection for my Galaxy 7| The fit had the edges exposed and the screen would pull off the glass of the phone whenever it dragged across anything or my fingers hit the exposed edge| The protector might work with certain protective cases| but not with the one I use| I had so many problems I returned the screen protector|
negtive,3,Good screenight protector| I like that there's a lifetime warranty on the product| I've only had it for 3 weeks and there's a small crack in the corner already| even though I haven't dropped my phone| And sometimes it's hard to type on the ends of the screen as it doesn't stick closely to the screen| Overall a good purchase and I'd buy it again|
positive,4,Zang makes a good screen protector with a lifetime warranty| The only con to this would be if you put your keys or change in the same pocket as your phone| If you do you will get cracks in the glass screen protector but better there than in your phone screen| They are very good about sending you a new one but you do have to pay shipping|
positive,4,i like ZAGG's glass screen protectors; i have one on my phone and it works quite well| and if it everr breaks they will send you a new one| my only complaint is that i have to pay $6 shipping whenever that happens| and thats about the price that i could pay for a different companies glass screen protector|
negtive,1,Zagg used to be the go to for screen protectors| Same yourself the headache and the money and don't buy this tempered glass| you will have a halo around the glass because it does not touch the screen| The screen curves before the edge of the phone| Do you research and don't listen to the sales associate| Buy a film screen protector instead|
negtive,1,Glass was to rigid| The sides would not stay down| I tried to return to best buy| they would not deal with it because it was open| Called manufacturers they did not hesitate to replace it they gave me several options on how to replace the product| I have no problem dealing with the manufacturer at all they were great|
negtive,1,I don't know how anyone could give this product better than a 1 star| It just doesn't fit and Zagg acts like it is suppose to hover over the edges of the phone where dust can get underneath it or it can snag on clothing| One of the poorest products I have ever seen from a normally very good company| Absolutely terrible product|
positive,4,Bought this vs the privacy screen because I care more about a broken screen over people judging my pinterest| Good product thus far it has done it's job| It's basically the same clarity you get from the original screen so I don't have to turn my brightness all the way up or block a glare| A little pricey but saves me in the long run I guess|
negtive,3,This is the second one of these that I've purchased and the first one was great| I had this one for all of 7 days before cracking it| That's my fault of course for dropping it| but my old one lasted over a year before cracking so I was a little disappointed| Comes with a warranty| but I'm too lazy to go through those steps|
positive,5,These products are well worth the money| They have protected my phone on many occasions| I just put a new one on my phone and within 2 days unfortunately I dropped my phone again| So off to the store to get a new one! These things are just amazing|
positive,5,I have 3 phones| two of which are my kids'| My oldest is not what you would call "gentle" with her technology| Every screen she's had she's managed to bust pretty much no matter what| This phone is the exception because while the shield is cracked and chipped you can clearly see the device screen underneath is still intact|
negtive,1,This item does not fit the S7 screen well at the edges| even when perfectly installed| A call to ZAGG revealed that they know this will not lie perfectly on the S7 surface| but that they are working on an update that will fit better| This begs the question of why they and Best Buy are selling it| Their answer: "it's better than nothing|" Boooo!
positive,4,I had the HD Invisible shield on my other phone for 2 years and had no issues| I heard good things about the glass shield so decided to upgrade with my phone purchase| Within a week| there is a crack down the entire shield|I gave it 4 stars as I'm not sure if this was a product defect or when it was installed by the store associate|
negtive,3,So I did not know that while this says that it is for the S7 it does not fit correctly| The screen is proportionate and everything except it tends to flex up around the edges of the screen| I was later told that it is the way the S7 is designed and the plastic protectors work better than the glass|
negtive,1,Bought this screen protector for my wife| Doesn't even lay flat on the edges| It also cracked during the application process| I'm glad that I only lost my best buy points to purchase it | The only reason for the lifetime warranty is it is way overpriced to begin | Buy any less expensive screen protector other than this piece of junk!
negtive,3,This protector gets the job done but it does not go edge to edge (designed for a cover)| My cover does not line up with the glass protector so there is an area around the phone that is not sealed and dirt gets under it| The glass protector was even placed by the Best Buy employee and she used the wipe cleaner first|
negtive,1,It does not fit on the screen properly| There is a slight curve on the S7 and this screen protector lay flat on the screen leaving a raised edge of the glass protector| As i tried to push it down more to make a seal| the glass cracked| However| Zagg customer service is great| Just do not waste your time with this specific model|
positive,5,I had a member of the Geek Squad apply this for me the day I upgraded to a Galaxy S7| and she did an amazing job| The glass itself makes your finger feel like it's swiping air| and honestly| feels smoother than the screen on some of my unprotected devices| even an iPad! And you can't beat the warranty on it| A good investment to be sure|
negtive,2,I have a black iPhone 6| The edges do not stick to the phone| It is very frustrating and the only reason I kept it is I got such a good deal on it| I would not recommend this| Even the employee said after she had applied it that this shield typically doesn't work with the black iPhone 6| Thanks for the heads up after applying it|
positive,5,I am pretty active and drop my phone at times| Nice to know that I can get something to help insure that when I do drop my phone that it will be protected to some degree| These things are not cheap so I feel it is acting responsible to protect an investment|
negtive,2,It does protect the screen| however it does not fit properly around the edges|I had mine installed at Best Buy and within one week| the edges have cracks| I don't drop my phone or abuse it at all| so that should not have happened| It is a new phone model and they still have some work to do in getting the proper screen protector for it|
positive,5,I was skeptical of purchasing a glass cover| the sales folks talked me into the added benefits of it and I have to say I love it| Like the way it is easier to do the swipe function with it| easier to keep clean and overall nicer appearance| And greater protections| I would recommend this as an option over the other screen protectors
negtive,3,I guess the way the S7 is shaped doesn't allow the the screen cover to lay flat||| not terrible unless you're a little neurotic| Debris can get stuck to the perimeter| but it is what it is I guess| So far I have dropped my phone a couple time and the screen has remained in tact despite the body of the phone cracking under the case|
positive,5,I was not sold on getting a glass cover but was convinced of the value by the sales person| She showed me her phone and how it looked and the value for protection| I must say| I am now a fan| It is easier to use the swipe function| and the phone screen is more readable with the glass cover| Appreciate the advice from staff member|
negtive,1,It protects my screen okay| but you have to live with cracks and nicks| It is easy to cause damage| I am a person who has never cracked my screen| so seeing dents and cracks on my protector screen was scary| I am going with another brand| even though it has a warranty| I don't want to go thru the hassle| over and over again|
negtive,1,I purchased this and the install from my local best buy store| A couple of days and there were already hairline fractures in the screen protector and the edges are bubbling up| I've not even dropped the phone or been hard on it| I'm not sure if the product is defective or if it was placed on incorrectly but it's very frustrating|
positive,5,Zagg really stands behind their products and I would never consider any other screen protector| They offer a lifetime warranty you can replace it as many times as you need to with and with Powerhouse like the Samsung S7| you need this to protect the screen! Perfect reliability - this is a must-have!
positive,4,This is a high quality item| Comes with all you need to install easily and you can feel the thickness and quality vs other competitive products| It is more expensive than others but in this case the quality does support the extra costs|||so it is a good value considering it will last twice as long as most other protectors
negtive,1,Several reviews commented that the screen easily cracked| Well| mine arrived from Best Buy SHATTERED| When I called customer service and explained this| the man paused and then said| "So| you are saying it is damaged?" I couldn't deal| Will be returning to a local store| Absolutely disappointed with my entire experience|
negtive,1,I purchased this screen protector with a new phone and it was installed by Best Buy Mobile| After installation| I noticed it did not adhere to the edges of the screen glass| Due to a slight curvature on the outer edges the screen on the Galaxy S7| the protector would not seat and could easily be removed| I took this protector back|
positive,4,Clearest screen protector I've had| no scuffs so far and crystal clear| Little on the pricey side but if it holds up in the long run well worth it| Now if only Otter Box would come with these I wouldn't have had to punch out the junky plastic screen cover and replace it with this|
negtive,1,I have the regular Galaxy S7 and this screen protector does not contour to the the shape of the screen| The edges of this screen have a slight curve to them| not as much as the edge but enough so that the edges of the screen protector do not lay flat| I have owned a Galaxy S5 with the glass Zagg protector and didn't have this problem|
negtive,2,The glass screen protector does not curve to fit the screen of the samsung galaxy s7| and therefore the glass sticks up and collects dust and dirt underneath it| Its a shame| because I really like zagg's shields| and they work really really well when they actually fit the intended product in the right way|
positive,5,Tami|Josh| and Carlos are fantastic to work with before|during| and after the sale| Carlos has helped us many times at the Samsung counter with other Samsung products| They are the reason we switched to Best Buy and Verizon from another carrier for two new phones and a tablet| It's like being with family as they are so friendly|
positive,4,New Galaxy S8 phone requires a new Zagg glass screen protector| I don't use any other type and have never had a phone screen shatter (although I have been through quite a few Zagg protectors - I drop my phone a lot)| I would have given it 5 stars| but the S8 is not as touch sensitive with this new protector on|
negtive,1,I let the sales person talk me into my first glass cover for the Galaxy S7| Put it on and immediately noticed it has about a quarter inch around the edge of the screen that the protector does not lay flat against| Even worse| it interferes with touch screen operation around edges| Not happy at all! Best Buy better give me a refund|
negtive,3,Cracked the screen within 6 days of getting phone| I was originally told there was a lifetime warranty but was never told I needed to contact manufacturer for product then bring that into the store to be installed| I'm going on my thirst screen in less then 1 month| I guess it does its job since my phone screen isn't broken|||
negtive,3,This wasn't my first time buying these screen protectors| but this time I was not too impressed| As I was applying the screen protector it cracked on the bottom just as I applied it| But otherwise it does do it's job| I have not had a cracked screen at all| just the protector has taken the scratches and cracks|
negtive,1,All zagg glass screens are awesome| Only problem is that new phones are all curving the edges of the screens at the edge| When applying this protector to the s7 it leaves a "halo" around the edge where the protector doesnt touch the screen| This area then collects dust and makes the outter most edge of my phone unusable|
positive,4,Happy with the protection it provides and the life time replacement warranty| Although you have to get it from Zagg| Best Buy will install the replacement for free if you paid for installation when you purchased it| Hate the beveled edges| although it looks cool| it can make it more difficult to type on the keys near the edges|
positive,5,I encouraged my wife to install this on her new phone because she is notorious for damaging phones| 3 days after installing the shield she dropped her phone and shattered this protector| I feel this saved her screen from shattering| I have always used Invisible Shield products and loved them all| Worth every penny|
negtive,2,Applied the screen protector on the phone's screen as directed in instructions| Bubble appeared and couldn't smooth it out| A week later my phone dropped on the ground (one time) and screen protector cracked immediately| Under warranty| I went to website to get a replacement and had to pay for shipping and handling for new one|
negtive,3,This Zagg screen protector seems to do its job of protecting the phone's screen| but it is not very resilient at all| Within 2 weeks there are 2 separate areas that have already cracked| I will be making a claim against the lifetime warranty so after that I may add a star or deduct another depending on how that goes|
positive,5,I bought this to replace the one on my phone that shattered| Protected the phone| However| learned the hard way (after installation) that warranty replacement must be done through the company website| So I lost money on this one||| not BB's fault|
positive,5,I've used Zagg covers on my phones for several years| They are constantly upgrading and improving their products|The nice thing about the glass shield is that it has a much nicer feel to the touch| Many screen protectors don't give the same touch sensation as the actual screen| These feel like the screen| I like that|
negtive,1,I've been through two InvisibleShield Glass protectors for the Galaxy S7| The shield does not adhere to the entire screen| Along both sides of the screen| there is a 1/8" gap where the shield remains off of the screen| Within a week| the shield cracks along this gap|
negtive,1,The product was not designed properly for the Galaxy S7| The installer tried three different covers and they all did the same thing and| that was for my phone| He also tried twice on my husbands and got the same result| I've dropped my phone twice (by accident) and now my screen is shattered in three places|
negtive,2,This cell phone shield for the screen is subpar in that it does not go completely to the edge and secure| there is an air gap all around the face of the screen so it isn't completely sealed|||it can still do the job as long as the center holds its place|||but it is better than nothing
negtive,1,It did not fit my Galaxy S7 and dust was collecting on the areas that did not fit|||||when I took my phone back due to other problems with the phone I asked about the size and fit|of|the screen and I was told he didn't know why it didn't fit and replaced it with a different HD screen that fit better|||||waste of money!!!!!!!
negtive,1,I'm a firm believer in Zagg products| I've been using them for years| This particular product is not well designed| It's not curved| and makes it hard to use the edges on the touchscreen| It's a shame Best Buy even sells this product| I hope I can return this product| I'll order from Zagg directly| the next time|
negtive,3,I just bought my new phone and screen protector a month ago| Only after 3 weeks| I noticed the side of my protector screen had a chip in it| There was no trauma done to the screen or phone to cause this| so I'm not sure what caused it to happen| I've never had an issue with Zagg| so I'm bummed this one broke so quick|
positive,4,Purchased this after recommendation from a Best Buy employee when returning the HD plastic Invisible Shield| I feel that my screen is more secure with the glass version versus the plastic| The only drawback is that it leaves a line going down both sides of the protector that looks like a line of dirt that can't be cleaned|
negtive,1,When I had an iPhone| I always purchased the Zagg glass for screen protection| Tried to do the same when I switched to Samsung| Discovered that (at least with the S7) the edges of the phone makes it difficult to apply the glass| Resulting look is an air bubble that circles the entire phone hence the nickname "halo"
negtive,2,I am really disappointed| My glass has 2 cracks| The 1st one occurred with a slight hit of a TV remote| The 2nd crack (no where near the 1st) just suddenly appeared| My phone has not been dropped or mishandled| If anything| buy the invisible shield| I have never cracked the glass on any phone I have ever owned|
positive,4,I LOVE Zagg shields! However| the BB associate who put on mine left air leaks on the side| Where the air bubbles are| it has cracked already after limited use| I registered my shield so I'll only have to pay shipping for another| but it's still a little frustrating| Make sure the shield is put on properly!
negtive,1,This ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 did not fit the S7!! It doesn't curve at the edges| and cracked the day after I installed the protector| I would give it a "0"| Do not waste your money on this item| I called Zagg and they recommended S7 users install the acrylic protector|
positive,5,This product works perfectly| I had it for about 2 days| dropped my phone| the glass cracked but the phone was fine| I sent it in for replacement with $6 shipping| they sent a new one and that lasted 4 days before the same thing happened||||phone still fine| They will keep shipping new ones for $6 forever|||||perfect|
negtive,3,Bought this screen saver for my mothers phone| she loves it| Only issue she had w/it| was that it wasn't put on correctly and started peeling| When she had it in her pocket| it peeled and cracked when she sat down| She had no issues getting it replaced| They send out new one w/a return envelope| to make it quick and easy|
positive,5,I researched a lot before choosing this screen protector| It had to be the best for my phone| Why protect it with anything less? I love that this has a lifetime warranty| My screen protector has cracked due to my boyfriend mishandling it and I was able to just request another one| all I had to pay for was the shipping|
positive,5,Tempered glass is not cheap but worth to buy| It is easy to clean| durable and doesn't easily leave finger marks compared to cheap ones| I also saw reviews online and people are saying manufacturer are true to their words on warranty| If you break it| manufacturer will replace it
negtive,1,I had this put on at the store and the technician did the best he could| But| the edge's of the screen must curve and there is 1/8" around all edges that is not stuck down| I carry my phone in my pocket and there is already lint and dirt under the edges and I have only had it a week|
negtive,3,I bought this for my galaxy s7| Fit is very good and it is wider than other screen protector glass| However| the edge of protector is weak||I think|| I have little cracking even if I did not have any big drop of my phone| Anyway| this warranty I believe will be good so they will provide good service|
positive,5,Doesn't even feel like you have a screen protector installed it is so smooth| I've tried installing these myself| and there's nothing worse than trapping lint or an air bubble under that shiny new protector| I recommend Geek Squad installation to insure you walk out with a perfectly clean clear screen|
positive,5,Love my Zagg tempered class screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S7| It looks just like the screen without a protector| Really works well| I somehow got a chip on the upper corner of the first one I purchased but my phone screen was undamaged| I had to replace the broken one| Love the way it looks|
negtive,3,Within the first 24 hours I dropped my phone 1 time and in that one time the glass cover got a scratch in it| The one I had on my old phone took a beating and barely had a crack in it| I am slightly bummed that this one hasn't handled as well| It still did its job| just bummed it happened in the 24 hour period|
negtive,1,Arrived as described| Actual glass was too big for the Galaxy S7| Where the edges bevel on the phone| the glass shield stayed raised since it would have to bend to adhere with the phone curves| so it never makes a complete seal| This caused the glass shield to crack with no virtually no pressure applied|
negtive,1,Zagg non glass screen protectors are great| however the glass ones are the worst! My phone dropped a short distance ON ITS BACK and the screen protector shattered after only having it a few days| My husbands also randomly cracked in his pocket within the first 2 weeks| The absolute worst protectors ever
negtive,2,I was hoping the prior reviews may have just gotten lemons but sadly no| the edges never stay down and it will soon become an issue as dust settles/edges raise| Save yourself the hassle and use a different model| The brand itself however| is good| which is why I gave it 2 stars (prior experience was awesome)|
negtive,3,I'm sure this type of screen protector works quite well with many phones| however due to the S7 having a slightly curved screen it cracks all along the sides and leaves an unsightly halo down both sides as well| This protector should not have been marketed for this phone|
positive,5,First smartphone| which I researched over 3 months| So happy with it and especially the quality of the camera and battery life-time| Am excited to learn more about the phone after taking a Samsung Workshop from Best Buy| which will maximize opportunities for me| Can't go wrong -- worth every penny of the investment|
negtive,3,Works as described| It keeps your screen cleaner than the otter box screen| but it breaks easy| And the replacement warranty is a joke| I contacted zagg about replacing my last one| It costs $7 to get it with the warranty| Really the warranty just says 'we will sell you another screen protector'
positive,5,Had BB put one of these on my wife's S7| Works great and is very clear| She throws her phone in her purse with about 8 million pounds of other things and so far this has kept the screen from picking up any scratches| Tends to smear a little bit with fingerprints and/or cosmetics but that is to be expected|
positive,5,I purchase from Best Buy because the product that they sell| the brandsthey make available are the Best Quality| the Geek squad technical support and warranties are excellent| the personal| is knowledgeable| helpful and courteous| Prices are either competitive or better|Buy Best BuyBest|Henry Young
positive,4,The screen protector worked well though it was a little difficult to get all of the spots out| I've put protectors on many times and this was not the easiest one to use| however| I would buy it again in the future|
negtive,2,I paid around $18 for this product| put it on my phone as instructed only to be left with these air filled lines at the edges of my phone| I applied as much as force as possible to get the air out without any success| Took it off and retried only to collect dust and hair on it| Waste of money|
positive,4,I don't like that it only comes with one cover| you get one good shot at applying| It can be done again| not as smooth| Comes with great kit to do it though - wet cloth and dry cloth to clean first and good steps| Haven't had it really put to the test for protection yet| so far so good|
negtive,1,This was bought for my Samsung Galaxy S7| When applying it| I almost had it perfect with no flaws but could not get rid of an annoying bubble in middle of screen| Reapplying it caused more screen imperfection issues that were impossible to get rid of| I am not using it on my phone as a result|
negtive,3,This screen protector is very clear and not detectable| except for the fact that mine has a crack in it| Perhaps the protector did its job by protecting the phone's screen| but it cracked right away after a very gentle bump (simply putting the phone down on a table; not tossing it or dropping it)|
negtive,1,The Zagg glass protector is flat and the Galaxy S7 has curved edges| If this sits in a tough case it may be fine| If you have a rubber case and tend to put the phone in your pocket the edge will crack| Sure it comes with a warranty| how useful is it when it will not last two weeks|
negtive,1,This does not fit the S7 properly and leaves what Zagg calls a halo effect around the screen where it will not stick| I contacted Zagg customer care and was told they are working on a curved one to fit the phone correctly but customers need to register and pay a 10 upgrade fee| Not cool Zagg
negtive,1,either make the protector smaller or find a way to have it work better the the curvature of the screen around the edges| I ended up only having it on my phone for a few weeks before too much gunk got under the edges| I pulled it back to try to clean the edges and it cracked in the bottom half| Would not recommend|
negtive,3,This is a great screen protector but I did break one within 2 weeks after using it|| ZAGG was great about replacing it but it did cost $5|99 for shipping| So don't knock your phone off of the counter or drop it very often because you will be requesting a new screen proctor often and the shopping costs will add up
positive,4,This screen protector is so much easier to install than the adhesive plastics| I will go with a glass cover from now on| The downside is that it can still get damaged| which happened pretty quickly for me| but only on one edge so I'm still using it and haven't submitted for a replacement under warranty yet|
positive,5,This is the first time I have used a screen protector| Installation was done in store by the Samsung rep| It was done before I realized he had even started| Invisible and functional| After reading the information with the product| I am sure I could have easily installed it myself| Great Service||
negtive,3,The associate applied the screen protector for me when I purchased my phone| When she was done| she said that there would be a halo effect around the edges but it would go away in a couple of days| It never went away and now it is cracked on the edge| On a good note| the screen underneath is not cracked|
negtive,3,This is my second screen| The first one I had to returned it| Didn't last long and my second one it's already broken| They have a lifetime guarantee but you have to paid shipping and handling and if I continued doing the returning of the product I will be ending paying more than the actual price|
negtive,1,If I could give this product no stars I would| The screen didn't even completely adhere time the s7 screen| Then After a week| the corners of at the top of the screen began to Crack and flake offor and cut my ear| Soo| Thank you zagg| I'm normally impressed with your product search| but not this one
positive,4,My Review its a good screen protector i had one for my old phone and i dropped my phone and the screen shattered i thought but it was only the screen protector and as i peeled it off my phone screen was fine| Only complaint i have is it does not fit the complete phone as my old one did|
negtive,3,Cracked easily| I was able to get a free replacement| I ordered online| paying only for shipping| It arrived in a timely manner| Returned cracked one in their postage paid envelope | I recently noticed a chip in the new shield| I'm not sure if I want to pay for shipping again| Next time I'll go back to plastic|
positive,5,I really like this product| I have bought for 4 phones so far| You have to pay to get Best Buy to install the first time then they will install any replacements for you for free| Zagg stands by their product and I will continue to purchase for future phones I get| A must have !
negtive,3,I have always used the other material to protect the display| I tried this one because it was recommended| The phone slipped out of my wore out holder I had attached to my belt and cracked within the first week| Not a good choice if your phone ever falls out of your hand or case|
positive,4,I bought one for my phone and one for the wife's phone| I broke mine| I don't know how| so I need to go get it replaced| Better to break the protector than the screen| Still able to use the phone just fine| I did think that this would be a bit more durable but I am satisfied with its performance|
negtive,1,I was expecting these glass shields to be much more scratch and crack resistant| Scratches much easier than the regular phone screen and cracks much easier too| My daughter's screen protector was completely cracked within two weeks| Glad they have a good warranty! But who knows how long the replacement will last|
negtive,3,I used to have the plastic shield and had no problems with it peeling or scratches| I was given the recommendation to try the glass| and I do not like it because of how easily it cracks and scratches| My screen on my phone is completely undamaged| however| after 1|5 years|
negtive,1,I've never been impressed since they started making glass screen protectors that don't cover the edges| Within one month of purchasing this| there were 4 chips on the edges and a crack starting from one of them| I requested a warranty replacement and got the original shield that goes to the edges|
negtive,3,So far| seems to protect my scree from dirt and scratches| However| the edges have still not molded to the screen so there is a bit of a halo effect around the edge| Not too big a deal but a bit annoying| Been about a month| feels like it shouldnt take this long| But the screen is protected so I'll put up with it
positive,5,Of all the screen protectors I have applied| this is absolutely the easiest! It literally took just minutes| There were initially 2 large bubbles| which smoothed right out with very little effort| I will be shocked if it ever comes loose around the edges| Great product|
negtive,3,I was very surprised by the way it crumbled around the edges so fast| I only had it on my phone a couple of months| I am very careful when handling my phone| Ithe was easy to install| I have to get another screen protector don't know if I m going to get the same one| Mixed feelings right now
negtive,1,I usually have a Otterbox on my phone and was talked into trying this product| While it is nice that it you can't see it or even feel that it's there| I already have two cracks in it| It does have a lifetime guarantee| which I've already sent off for| but I've only had it 3 weeks| Very disappointed|
negtive,1,The screen protector does not cover the whole screen which would be fine if it didn't hang over the slightly curved edges of the Galaxy S7(I don't have the S7 Edge)| The edges became less and less responsive to touch then unusable| There are plenty of Glass screen protectors that are similar for under $10|
negtive,2,On a Galaxy S7 this screen would not seal at the edges| about 1/4 of an inch was raised up and would not stick| I had it installed by the Geek Squad guys initially| Returned it and they replaced and reinstalled but still had the same problem| I exchanged for the plastic version and it worked better for me|
positive,4,The application of the screen protector is great| The more fragile areas are the locations near the speakers and front cameras| I wish the glass was a little thicker in these spots| My protector broke in these two locations after a week| I work in the Automotive repair field
positive,4,I like the screen shield overall| It was easy to install with the guide tabs| My screen responds well through the shield| I didn't give 5 stars because there is a distinct line on both sides of the shield that doesn't adhere to my screen| I do have a case so the shield isn't peeling off|
positive,4,I love the Zagg brand and their warranty||||I never had a problem|||easy to get a new one| This is the first time I bought a glass one vs| a membrane one| There is a halo around the edge of mine and mine cracked within the week| Unsure if I am just hard on my phones| but my phone was totally protected|
negtive,1,Do not buy! This screen protector does not fit! The halo effect they describe is in fact the screen protector not appropriately fitting the s7| This screen protector is flat| The s7's screen had curved edges| The halo is where the screen protector doesn't adhere to the screen|
negtive,1,This is a horrible product| I wish the sales clerk would have known that this Glass protector would have broken because of the tapered edge of the glass on my S7 they should not sell this product| The old plastic screen protector is the way to go on anything with a beveled peace of glass!
positive,5,I dropped my phone while outside| and of course it completely missed the yard and landed on the driveway| Thank goodness the shield did its job and protected the phone| Quick replacement of the shield and all is well!
positive,5,I have purchased multiple Zagg protectors in the past and all have been excellent| Their customer service is second to none| One of my phones was stolen| and after I gave them proof of purchase| they sent me another glass free of charge! Only paid shipping| Can't ask for more than that|
negtive,1,Flat glass that doesn't fit the rounded edge S7| geek squad knows they don't fit but still offer it just to have them returned| It leaves about a 1/4" of both sides of screen not stuck down|I returned it and had to go to another store to buy a soft screen protector because B|B| was sold out
positive,5,I love this produce| I had one on an older phone and I dropped it and the screen protector shattered| It was time to upgrade so took it and they would only take it as a trade in if the screen wasn't broken| We took off the protector and the phones scene was unharmed| Will always use this product|
negtive,3,I bought this based on the recommendation of the Best Buy associate| It seems fine and it's worked without any issues| My biggest complaint is it seems a little small for the Samsung S7| There is a small gap between the edge of the protective screen and the edge of the phone's screen|
negtive,2,the screen protector does not curve at the edges and overhangs| The screen protector is brittle and breaks easily at those edges| the phone fell on my bed then to the carpet and broke at the edge where it overhangs on the first day| don't waste your money on this product| find one that curves at the edge|
positive,4,I've had good luck with Zagg products in the past| this screen protector is no exception| I have a problem with the edges of the screen protector cracking; this isn't a knock on the product| I think the case I'm using is causing the problem| Otherwise| the protector does what it's supposed to do|
negtive,1,Don't do what I did|||Read reviews (mainly negative) and still purchase|As stated by others| the sides lift| causing the glass to separate and chip| Took less than a month for this product to become inferior and returned for a full refund|I recommend the Lifeproof Fre case for the Samsung Galaxy G7|
positive,5,I hate having air bubbles or scratches on my screen protectors and this has solved my problem| It is well worth the cost| Also the best buy rep put the screen protector on for me so I did not stress too much about dust or air bubbles between the screen and the protector| Thank you so much|
positive,5,I bought this for my new phone| Zagg glass works as advertised| When I had it on my old phone and the glass cracked| I was able to get a new one from Zagg| The process was easy and even easier to put it on my phone myself| This definitely protects your phone screen and is worth every single dollar!!!
negtive,2,This screen protector chips way too easily| Several days after having it installed on my phone it cracked on the edge without any apparent cause| It looks like a small pre-existing edge defect allowed the glass to chip next to the power button| After several more days a crack formed and grew|
negtive,1,Does not adhere to the curved edges allowing dirt| dust and hair to get stuck to the exposed section| Zagg calls it full coverage and claims that it is by design| But then explained they are currently working on a redesig| (Not sure how it's getting 3|5 stars over all with all these bad reviews)
positive,4,good| clear protect except does not stick to the edge of the screen| creating a 'halo' edge effect| this impacts the touch screen sensitivity| as you must press harder in that area to make it work| Installed at Best Buy| who promised to notify me when a fix is available (still waiting - several months)|
negtive,2,I love the products| but not this version| Day one the glass cracked and webbed| Day 3 or the second one and it shattered and webbed| I'm ocd about protecting my phones and this was with general use and button push home screen area on gs7| Avoid this| get the regular plastic/original screen protector!
positive,5,This is 2nd Zagg shield for this phone| The 1st one suffered a crack after falling from roof of house onto a rock pile| I thought phone would be destroyed but thanks to Zagg (and a dollar store case) the phone and screen were fine| Thanks Zagg!
negtive,3,Disappointed that this screen broke in less than 24 hrs| I didn't drop my phone or drop anything on it| Just looked over and the screen was cracked| Happy that Zagg replaces the screen for free| minus shipping and handling| but I shouldn't have had to use this "free pass" so soon or without reason|
positive,5,We dropped my phone on rocks in Maui taking a selfie and it looked like the screen was shattered| but it was only the zagg protector that was shattered and they mailed me a new one for only a few dollars in shipping costs|
negtive,1,To start I will say the screen protector is easy to install but the glass does not completely adhere to the phone leaving an air gap the whole way around the phone allowing dust to easily make its way under the edges| For the price of this thing the edges should be flawless|
negtive,1,waited a couple months until zagg fixed their measuring errors for the samsung galaxy s7 screen protector but i think i still bought an old version (if they even fixed the error)| i never attached the screen but holding it to my phone it still looked small and for the price wouldnt risk it|
negtive,1,dont waste your money on this screen saver| i purchased new when i bought new phone| dropped it one time and shattered along the edge| wife bought the same thing and the exact same thing happened with hers| we will be going back to the old non-glass style screen saver in the future|
negtive,1,Do not buy this for your phone if you expect it to fit your phone from edge to edge| Even though it is for a S7 and not a S7 edge the phones screen is still a little curved and it will not lay flat on the edges of the screen| It also will collect lint| dirt| etc| along the edges|
negtive,2,This glass shield for the Samsung S7 has known problems ( halo around edges| does not seal) but I decided to get because I figured some protection is better than none| I have gotten several replacements from Zagg through their lifetime warranty ($5|99 shipping)| which they're good about|
negtive,2,The glass screen does not follow the contour around the edges of the Galaxy S7| The phone has a downward slope and the glass does not bend| Hence| there is a noticeable edge around the entire edge|I gave it a two because Zagg customer service was great and provided me a non glass replacement|
negtive,3,screen protection is great| doesn't seem to scratch| 3 stars do to the edges of the protector do not contour to the phone screen| After having the phone in my pocket for a few weeks there is a noticeable amount of lint between the screen and the protector at the edges|
positive,4,I bought this when recommended by the Best Buy guy| So far it's been good| I have dropped my phone a few times with no problems| It's only been a month so I am not sure if It will actually prevent my phone from cracking| but so i've dropped my phone and neither the shield or the screen have cracked|
negtive,2,This screen protector does not fit all the way to the sides| Evidently| the s7 is slightly beveled on the edges| I'm sure the next generation will be better| At the time of purchase| it was all that was available| It does the job| but I'd like better fit and finish||| not that I'd sacrifice function!
positive,5,I'm super clumsy when it comes to my phone| I've dropped the thing way to many times but this product saves my screen every time| What's even better is that it has a great warranty so when I inevitably crack the screen protector I'll be able to get another| Well worth the price|
negtive,1,One of the worst protectors I've had to replace twice already it cracks on its own I went from having iPhone to galaxy purchase same product before in the past which I had great experience with but on this phone the product isn't durable doesn't last not even a month don't waste your money
positive,5,I got this for my wife's phone| and it saved her screen when it fell off her lap while she was sitting in the car and it landed screen first on the driveway| The screen protector shattered| but her phone was completely undamaged| I bought this one to replace her first one|
positive,4,I really like the glass screen I got for my my new Samsung S7 it is very clear no bubbles on the screen I did get one scratch on it already but I am also very hard on my phone and I dropped them a lot so I wouldn't say it was a bad product had I not had one on my screen would have been cracked
negtive,1,ZAGG - Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Bought this item when I bought my phone| walked out of best buy and dropped my phone while getting in my truck| hit ground and the shield cracked| I'll never waist my money again on this|
negtive,1,The edges of the glass do not meet the screen| functions just fine| but the official stance from zagg as of now is 'It works as intended| if you dont want the "halo" get a different shield'| I have seen the press release in store my self| This is nonsense|
positive,5,You definitely need this to protect your screen| In less than one month| I needed a new protector| Fortunately I had this| otherwise| the screen would've been cracked in several places| The rep was also helpful in getting this shipped out quickly| and the best buy folks put it on the phone|
negtive,2,This "protector" never adhered properly| There was about 1/8" around the entire screen that just didn't stick| Slowly| more seems to be peeling up| It's also already cracked in 4 places| without being dropped or hit| I'm usually satisfied with Zagg protectors| but not this one|
negtive,1,The edges don't stick| On the second day it cracked| I took it back and they couldn't replace it because I have to go through Zapp and pay for shipping to get a new one it's been one month since I've had it and a have multiple cracks and I have not dropped my phone once| It's just super sensitive|
positive,4,I have had two of these screen protectors in the last 2weeks| and my new one was for the Samsung galaxy s7 and it doesn't appear to fit||| there is a halo around the whole screen| Best buy was amazing for fixing the first one| hoping the company fixes this in the future|
positive,5,Although you can't see it| you know that it is there and it is protecting your investment - your phone| Since I put my phone directly in my purse| and who knows what is it there| I know that there will not be any scratches on the phone's glass when I pull it out of my purse| I would recommend|
positive,4,I have to put a screen protector on my phone for my own piece of mind| This one however doesn't lay perfectly flat because if the tiny curve to the screen| It has been ok but you can see a little outline area around the outside that isn't laying perfectly flat|
positive,4,This screen protector has protected my screen pretty well| I had one on my last phone that kept it protected the whole two years| The only complaint I would have is that the screen protector looks scratched or cracked and it almost looks like my phones screen is really cracked but it's not|
positive,5,The Zagg Shield has saved the cell phone several times when it fell| great product| They also have a great customer svc dept| I had a zagg on a previous phone that was about 4 yrs old and it started getting bubbles and dirt under it| they replaced it with no issues| Very easy process|
negtive,1,My Wife bought one for her iPhone and it fit great so I bought one for my Galaxy S7| it didn't fit well at all| The edges wouldn't stay down| nothing we did would keep the edges down| Waste of money| now I have to find one that will actually work on the S7||
negtive,1,Because of the halo edges that are around the perimeter | the screen covers cracks easily| I never had this happen before but I have put two new screen protectors on and both have cracked within a day or two| Not recommended|
positive,5,Cracks too easy and my girlfriend dropped her phone and the protector cracked and allowed the screen on phone to get scratched itself| I have dropped my phone many times with a different style and it hasnt even tried cracking|
negtive,2,Either BestBuy associates are putting the screen protector on incorrectly or this is simply a bad choice for the Samsung s7| 1st time| it cracked around the edges on day 3| Ordered a free replacement from Zagg| Brought it to Best Buy to put on ||| cracked around the edges again on day 2|
negtive,3,This cover is to protect your phone screen and it did that but in just a short time not even two weeks noticed a slight nick in it! Had one before this for two years and never had one problem with it! It was for an Iphone not a Samsung| so not sure if that is the difference or what!
negtive,1,Not sure if it protects the screen from impact because I haven't dropped it| It does seem to be chipped on an edge| I noticed a white spot when it was installed at Best Buy now it seems to chip away| Lifetime guarantee but zagg wants about 1/3 of the price I paid for the exchange|
negtive,1,I paid $39|99 for this screen protector at the advice of Best Buy staff| I did not drop my phone or even bump it but the glass protector is already cracked after just 24 hours| I had the cheap plastic one on my other phone and it never had anything go wrong in 2 years| DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
negtive,1,Because the 7 curves a little the glass shield does not sit flush on the edges| Within a few days it already cracked| My boyfriend got the same one and his lasted about 2 weeks before it cracked| Now we have to go thru warranty to get another one| Looking for a different protector
negtive,2,Disappointed in the durability of this screen shield| Have only had for a couple of months and shield is already cracked in a couple places| Will go with a plastic shield as a replacement when this shield is no longer tolerable| Much cheaper alternative with better long-term protection|
positive,5,This shield is absolutely great! It keeps my phone safe from cracks when dropped and the screen is now so crystal clear to view| Even my fingerprints don't show on the phone| Wish I had gotten one sooner| Makes a great Christmas gift for family and friends|
negtive,3,I always prefer the glass for screen protectors| but this glass is NOT shaped exactly the same as the phone which leaves a halo on both sides where the screen protector doesn't actually touch the screen| I may end up removing the glass and switching to a plastic screen protector|
negtive,1,This brand is always awesome| But on this phone| The HD glass cover does not work well| Since the edges are slightly rounded there is a halo effect when the class is on there| meaning the edges around the whole screen protector slightly lift off of the glass|
negtive,3,Love how this feels when swiping and also protecting| HOWEVER| this will not fully seal around the edges of glass| I took it back to Best Buy and asked the Geek Squad and they said it never will| Seems that it should seal that last 1/16"| Will find out how much dirt gets around it|
negtive,1,Bought and had best buy install in store| While the associate was installing cover he warned me of the cover not fitting properly| the screen has a slight curve at the edge while the protector does not| Have had for 3 days and have cracks al through out edges| do not buy
negtive,3,this cover allowed for no damage after i dropped my phone on the pavement in 20 degree weather so it did its job||however||i find that the touch screen and texting require a lot more pressure than my old plastic screen cover| it works but it kind of deadens the touch response
negtive,2,I've used invisibleshield on just about every phone I've had since 2010| This particular one is very difficult to install correctly| and the install wipe is terrible| Ended up buying the original style invisibleshield which was much easier to install and has served me well so far
positive,5,This was highly recommended as THE screen protector to get for my Galaxy S7 and I agree| No problems whatsoever using my phone| It also gives me peace of mind that it will Crack instead of my screen| Was told it has free lifetime replacements| If true| then we'll worth the money|
positive,5,The glass shield gives me an extra sense of protection| I have dropped the phone since I purchased it and thankfully it did not chip or break| I would like to think the glass shield prevented any damage to the phone| I hope not to drop it again to prove my theory wrong| Smile|
negtive,2,I had the gadget geeks at best buy put this screen on for me| I'm not sure if I got a defective one from the beginning but it broke/cracked within the first few days and I had not dropped it or anything| I went back in to best buy and they did refund my money for the purchase|
negtive,3,The protector applied easily without air bubbles| The problem I have with the Galaxy S7 is near the screen edges it has a slight curve which doesn't allow the protector to adhere right up to its edges| Time will tell if this will present to be an issue|
negtive,1,Husband eyes are sensitive to light so he wears polarized sunglasses which this glass shield leaves lines throughout the screen but if you hold it sideways it's fine| We will have to return this due to this reason other wise it might work for others without these type of glasses|
negtive,1,DO NOT BUY! I only purchase Zagg Glass for my phones| This product is poorly designed for the S7| The edges of the Glass do not seal| The S7 has a slight contour that does not allow the Glass to seal properly| Very disappointed with Zagg|
positive,5,This is the best screen protector I've ever owned| It's a little on the pricey side but| protector doesn't diminish the phone's resolution quality and protects your screen from impacts| I've dropped my phone several times on the face| No cracks on the protector or scratches|
negtive,3,I didn't know or wad told when i bought this product that the edges do not seal properly due to a curve on the phone's screen| When the tech put it on my phone| he broke one| Within two weeks of the second one| it also got a chip in it| The glass screen for my s5 never broke once|
negtive,3,At first use the screen protector is made of good material and went on smoothly| At first I thought I got the wrong one but once I talked to a clerk found out that they are not made of the curve of the screen on the edges| So just a tad of material sticks out beyond the screen|
positive,5,Best protector out there| May be a little more money then others but well worth the $$| If you register screen and something happens to it they will send you a new one| Great product for 5 different phones for me personally|
positive,5,Great screen protector| It is durable| very transparent| You can't even tell it is there| yet you are getting the protection from costly screen damage repair| It does not interfere with the touch screen use| I recommend this for protection & peace of mind!
positive,5,very good shield| bought two of these when getting my phones| my son tried to adjust his glass screen protector and ended up breaking the screen protector we contacted the company and within a week we had a new screen protector| with no hassles from the company I'm impressed with them
positive,5,Protects cell phone screen just as described| I dropped my phone hit pavement protective shield cracked (hairline crack) removed it from phone my phone screen was intact| Sent it back to manufacturer and they sent me back a replacement shield honoring their lifetime warranty|
negtive,1,I've gone through two of these| It doesn't adhere to the edges of the screen| so it cracks and you can't use the edges of the touch screen (like the period button on the keyboard!) So now I'm out the purchase price as well as the 5|99 for warranty replacement shipping| Terrible product|
negtive,3,The sales guy at best buy said that the way this is made that the edges aren't down| This seemed odd and this week I found out that it is odd| The glass screen chipped| There is a lifetime warranty but you have to pay for shipping| I hope the one I receive "sits" better on the screen|
positive,4,The only thing that makes this screen protector any better than the cheaper ones is that you can get a replacement if you register it for the lifetime warranty| Other than that| go with the cheaper one| It protected my screen| but it's already cracked in less than 2 months|
negtive,3,I have a Galaxy S7 and the edges are showing shadows| I talk to Best Buy about it and they said there is a specific protector for the Galaxy S7 but they do not carry it| Talked to Zagg and they said there is not a specific protector for the S7 and that this was a known issue|
positive,5,These screen savers have saved my cell phone many times from having to replace the screen every time I drop it| Instead just replace the screen saver| the glass screen underneath is in perfect shape| It is the first accessory I buy when getting a new phone|
negtive,1,My wife was changing phone cases and dropped her phone| With this on her phone| she has a crack from the dropping| I doesn't work and I had to have mine replaced| What a run around| Two trips to the store| had to contact vendor| pay for shipping for replacement|
positive,4,The protection factor is great on this thing; the attractiveness isn't| Upon applying it to my phone then putting on the case| parts of it bubbled up and makes the appearance less attractive| It's not the worst thing in the world| but I wasn't thrilled about this small dilemma|
positive,5,Bought my first Invisibleshield Glass Screen protector| So far I love the glass shield because unlike the plastic screen protectors that you can scratch and gouge the plastic on the screen protector|I have had it on my phone for a month and no indication of gouging|
positive,5,I think with technology advancing the way it is| the term Cell Phone needs to be further extended to include all the features of these handheld giants|Perhaps a "name the widget" campaign to rename the device to all persons to all persons who own one| may promote a true identity|
negtive,2,For the Samsung S7| this brand of screen protectors are horrible| All of them come up around the edges due to the phone having a very slight curvature| It's just a waste of money| I've found better screen protectors by other brands that are the same price and don't come up|
negtive,1,Bought this & it tore/cracked the first day I got it| I should have taken it back immediately| but I went through the guarantee process| which cost another $6 for shipping| Have now read other reviews warning this cover doesn't fit well and I can confirm the same| Don't bother|
negtive,3,It protects my screen well enough but it doesn't cover the sides as well as I thought it would since the s7 is slightly curved| No real problems installing it and fits well minus the problem I mentioned before|
negtive,2,This screen protector was easy to apply| but it did not fit very well| It never sealed very good around the edges of the screen| I will probably try another brand when this one starts to come loose| as it certainly looks like that will happen in the very near future|
positive,5,I had bought this noticed product before and it started to crack on the side thought it was the glass of the phone but it was the shield| Better the shield than the phone | so I bought an other on and installed it within minutes| Works and looks great|
negtive,1,New S7| Protector started to deteriorate within days of putting it on| I went back to BB and was told they had numerous complaints| Apparently the phone is curved in such a way that it rejects the protector| I was told Zagg would be coming out with a protector compatible with the S7
negtive,1,The concept is a good idea| however it chipped and cracked the first day just being in my pocket with my keys and some change| To replace| I have to deal directly with Zagg and then take it to Best Buy for installation| Both are fully covered but a real pain to make work|
positive,5,The product works as advertised| I have not broken a screen since I started using these 3 or 4 phones ago| I now upgrade my phone because I want to instead of having too because of a broken screen
positive,4,I gave the screen protector 4 stars because it chips kind of easy when the phone is dropped| Unfortunately I have dropped it a couple of times but it did help protect the screen which is the purpose| I still like the product and will buy it again when I upgrade later on|
negtive,3,I have the same screen for my phone and it has been great for two years| So when my husband needed a new screen protector I felt this would be best| Unfortunately it has already broken| If they stand by their lifetime guarantee then my rating will go up to a 5|
positive,5,Great InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7| Protects my Samsung Galaxy S7 device with this InvisibleShield glass screen cover| Featuring fortified tempered glass construction| this cover defends against scratches to extend your screen’s life|
negtive,3,Simple item and doesn't it's job so can't complain much||| strangely it seems to gap - in clean line| on both sides - as if for the edge instead of the regular s7| Now due to that gap it's cracked along an edge but it's still working so functionality matters most
negtive,1,This did not fit to the edge of my s7| it had a halo around all the edges| I could not get used to the look! Very disappointed!! Do not buy! Zagg is working on making a glass screen protector for this phone| you can ask Zagg to email you when one is available| I suggest waiting!!
positive,4,This was so slick! The salesperson put on in store| Immediately adheres to screen and is clear without bubbles| My husband got one for his too! His cracked on the side within days| not sure what happened there| but received a replacement free of charge| We both have been pleased|
negtive,1,I have always liked my Zagg protectors on other phones| but due to the slight curve on the S7 this protector wouldn't adhere to the edges and left an easy gap to peal off| Returned very easily to Best Buy| No complaints with the service| just a poorly designed product|
negtive,2,I love that the screen protector looks and feels like the plain screen of the phone| but the edges of this protector did not glue tight to the screen and made my new phone look used and beat up| Ended up removing and buying a better brand online|
positive,5,I told the salesman I wanted one of those screen savers for my phone and he pick this one out and was good enough to install it on my phone for me| He did a good job and I don't even notice that it is even on it| It is clear and will help save my screen from getting mark up|
positive,4,My screen looks cracked| Hopefully it is the Zagg glass screen| I will find out when I bring it in to Best Buy to check out| The glass screen makes a great display| It is clear and smudgeless| Zagg always stands behind their products| so I am hopeful to have it replaced|
positive,5,I bought one of these after I broke the glass on my Galaxy S7 about 2 weeks later the phone slipped from my hands and landed dead on it face on jagged rocks and the screen protector cracked but my phone was fine 35 bucks is much better than 200 to replace the screen
negtive,1,This was recommended by Best Buy personnel| DO NOT GET IT! It will leave the edges unsealed| I spoke with ZAGG about this and they have another product for the non-EDGE S7 that they sell that Best Buy does NOT sell - get it from them!
positive,5,I will say that this item does what it is supposed to do| I dropped my phone and it shattered the screen protector| My phone screen however was completely intact| Definitely worth the $$ I paid for it| I use this with the otter box defender case|
negtive,1,doesn't fit phone properly thus cracking at the edges| It's a poor design| I wouldn't recommend this product if you want to keep you phone looking nice| It is under warranty but I don't want to have to go back in every couple of weeks and replace my screen protector|
negtive,2,This screen protector was recommended by the Samsung rep as well as the Best Buy employee and I'm not happy that they did not know it would not fit the phone correctly| Lots of dirty gets stuck under the edge because it does not fit the screen correctly| Otherwise it is fine|
positive,5,Phones these days are basically just mini computers with price tags to match| I wouldn't let my investment go unprotected| These work exceptionally well and they are guaranteed a free replacement if they crack as long as you register your purchase|
positive,4,Overall| I like this screen protector| It went on relatively easily| without too many bubbles| However| I am concerned that the area along both the left and right edges of the screen protector don't appear to be completely adhering to the phone's screen|
negtive,3,This is not the best protector for your phone but it does cover you screen and protect it| You will notice on the side of the protector that it doesn't completely stick to your phone| I have dust collecting on the sides| But it is doing exactly as advertised|
negtive,1,Within a couple days after the screen protector was applied to my phone by a Best Buy sales associate| it had already started to chip and actually cut my finger when I was reaching in my purse to get the phone| It also has a huge bubble on the top left side!!!
negtive,1,This is not a good screen cover and I would not recommend it| Within a few days of install by the Best Buy Geek squad it started peeling back and coming off| I was given a replacement and it did the same thing| For the cost you would think it would stay on for a while|
negtive,3,My Galaxy s7 has the curved screen edges| This shield appeared to not cover the screen enough and would cause a problem with the edges lifting up from use| I found a case that included a screen protector and meets my high standard of protecting a very expensive phone|
negtive,2,I purchased 2 new phones and wanted a reliable screen protector| The sales associate recommended this product| 2 weeks later one of the screen protectors is cracked on the side which could easily cut fingers| I am giving this a 2 star rating because of this|
negtive,1,The edges of the S7 screen are| apparently| slightly curved| However this screen protector| apparently| is not| The edges of the protector never adhered to the screen edges| As a result| several cracks developed in the edges of the screen protector|
positive,5,I have dropped my phone a couple of times while trying to juggle too many items and the only damage I have is to the corner of my shield glass| No damage to the actual phone glass| I have been using these shields for the past 4 years and love them!
positive,4,Great screen protector| Honestly my favorite thing about it is not having to clean the screen| simply wipe it with a clean cloth| Only reason for 4 stars is even the standard S7 has a slight curve on the edges of the screen so interacting with the edges can be difficult|
negtive,3,The protector is good until it broke very easily while my charger hit the top ! Its not very good protection but when its brand new it feels so smooth | The guy who put it on did a good job but these bubble marks were around the sides |
negtive,1,I do not recommend this tempered glass screen for the Galaxy S7| Because the S7 has a slight curve on the side| it leaves giant space between the screen of my phone and the tempered glass allowing dust and other funny stuff to get inside| I suggest the HDX instead|
positive,4,Godd-maybe even very good| It does have a small chip now| It doesn't bother me| My granddaughter dropped my phone on concrete| It bounced | but didn't break| Without the shield I'm sure there would have been major damage|
negtive,1,I've used other brands of screan protectors before Zagg has always been the best| NOT in this case! The "halo" allows for the screan protector alows ot to lift up and if you have a case on the phone it's even worse| It pushes on it too| Very disappointed|
negtive,2,It was difficult to install| and if you mess up the installation| the product is ruined| Once it is installed| it easily scratches on the surface| While not on your screen| it becomes difficult to see when they build up over time|
negtive,3,Easy to install| Does what it says and has prevented scratches and breaks TO MY SCREEN| But| simply dropping it in my pocket with other items will cause it to be scratched and busted causing the purchase of another one| Drop the price!
positive,4,I tried cheaper brand screen protectors| The protector itself cracked up so couldn't view phone screen| Zagg worth the money| Performs as stated though did not last a full year| Perhaps warranty would cover it| My first Zagg lasted 6 months|
positive,4,I really bought it for my Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge phone because this is what popped up there when I typed in the search bar online for the screen protector for it| It's an okay one for the Samsung Galaxy s7 phone| If I had to go with a different one I would|
positive,4,Glass is simple to install and has a lifetime guarantee| I had one break on a previous phone and getting a replacement was simple| Only issue I have with this one is that it is difficult to get the glass on with 0 air trapped but it's a minor thing|
negtive,2,Bought the glass screen cover after best buy employee recommendation| It cracked and started peeling in the front by camera lense within 3 weeks| Didn't drop phone| or anything else to cause it on my end| Took it back and got it replaced| So far so good with this one|
negtive,3,I love Zagg| but this protector isn't a good match for the S7| The S7 has a slightly curved screen (unlike the S7 Edge| which has a fully curved screen) and the protector is about 1/8"-1/16" short of "sticking" to the full screen| I expect better from Zagg!
negtive,1,The product "halos" which means it doesn't form fit and all around the shield it pops up a little| It keeps popping off| And it is super irritating| And it doesn't span across the entire screen| This sucks| I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE|
positive,5,I purchased this product for my previous phone| and after dropping my phone 1|000 times or so| I finally cracked my screen protector| Zagg replaced it quickly and easily| no problem| It's an excellent product| saves me from my clumsiness| and I am a fan for life!
negtive,1,The protector is very nice in the middle| but it doesn't curve for the edge of the screen| There is a halo all the way around that doesn't touch| Being inside my pocket it gets little pieces of things underneath it|
positive,5,I have dropped my phone way too much| The Zagg glass protector has just a tiny crack along the edge| I know it has been protecting my phone so that glass on the phone itself hasn't cracked| Phew!
negtive,2,The screen protector is okay when using your phone| but when the phone is off you can see an edge all the way around the phone as if the screen protector isn't sticking correctly|
positive,4,This product is good to protect scratches| but I don't think it is worth the retail price they are charging for it| When talking to a Best Buy associate they informed me BB would price match Amazon which saved me a about 40%| For that price I think it is a good deal|
positive,5,The S7 provides me with a much clearer and brighter screen| It is much easier to delete calls and E-Mails as a group| I read facebook a lot and the quality of pictures| etc| Is great| I am thoroughly enjoying my n ew S7 phone|
negtive,3,The Zagg invisible glass shield is protective for the screen of my Samsung S7| That should be expected| The fit to the screen is not very good| The shield lifts at the edges and in one corner of the screen the shield has cracked because of this problem|
positive,4,Crystal clear protection for your phone's screen| It has a nice "natural" feel to the touch screen when applied| The only down side is that it does crack more easily than other screen protectors| Better for the protector to crack than the screen itself| however|
negtive,2,Seemed very nice at the beginning| My toddler got ahold of my phone and dropped it| The screen protector is cracked| Although I am happy nothing happened to the phone| It was less than a foot drop for the protector to break| I will be calling for a replacement|
negtive,2,I am not thrilled with it| but it is ok enough that I will live with it| The problem is the the S7 has a slight bevel to the glass| so this overlay does not seal tight on the edges| As a result| it collects little dust crumbs that make me crazy| Bleh|
positive,5,Had one on my last phone and it lasted two and a half years before I replaced my phone| It had only a couple of small cracks from dropping the phone| but better Zagg protection then cracking my phone screen| I will keep buying ZAGG screen protectors|
negtive,2,Don't know what happened| Have never dropped the phone but this has cracked on one phone after two months| I am using it with a Samsung flip cover| so that front of the phone (and so this screen protector) is always covered when the phone is not actually in use|
positive,4,These glass screen protectors work great and have saved my sons screen from cracking on his Samsung phone| The screen protector cracked| but not the actual screen| Zagg does charge a 5|99 shipping and handling fee but replaces the protector at no cost|
negtive,2,Very easy to install| very clear| like the glass| It broke in the first week| Best Buy exchanged but I hope I don't have to do that every week| If you use outside or in a car it is impossible to read if you have polarized lens| Must be the anti glare they put on it|
positive,4,I installed the Zagg myself| which is not my strong suit| I have to admit it's easy to do but you only have one shot at getting it right| If money is not an option| it is far easier to pay Best Buy to install the shield| but this one is easy enough to do by yourself|
positive,4,Have used zagg products on my last few phones| They work well and do their job| They do Crack after a decent fall since they are glass but the warranty makes up for a replacement just paying for shipping| Which is minimal cost compared to replacing a phone screen|
positive,4,The glass is clear and allows a easy view of all icons| Application was a little trickey since its a 1 shot deal| I could not get all the air bubbles and while trying to reajust the scene it cracked|
negtive,1,the glass dont curve with the phone the edge did not stick return it the first time cause thought it was a defect from me putting it so pay them to put on and said the glass will curved after couple days but never did and started to crack around the edge
positive,5,Recently the screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S7 shattered| I went to Best Buy where a courteous and knowledgeable Best Buy employee expertly and quickly replaced the screen protector| My phone looks as it did when I purchased it| Thanks Best Buy!
negtive,1,This product does not fit the S7 phone| Mine cracked during the install so I returned it to the local retailer| The phone has a slight curve on the edge and the screen protector is completely flat leaving a slight gap on the sides| Horrible product|
positive,4,This screen protector will probably work fine| however per the store clerk for some reason the edge all the way around has a slight lip due to the S7 screen being slightly beveled| I think it's still the best choice for the phone|
negtive,3,Best screen protector but the glass screen protector for galaxy 7 does not seal around the edge of the screen| The screen slightly curves and the glass protector doesn't adhere to it| Great product with a slight problem| Hopefully Zagg will come up with a solution|
negtive,3,Screen protector works well but it doesn't fit the screen of the phone correctly| The edge of the phone is slightly curved and the glass cover doesn't bend| You end up with a halo around the edge of the phone and dust can gather underneath that edge|
positive,5,This is my second screen saver for this phone| The first one did its job and protected my phone when if fell out of my pocket| I'm sure this one will do the same| It also has a lifetime warranty if you register it (I didn't do this on the first one)|
positive,4,I've bought Zagg products in the past and I bought this based on my experience with them| The protector is great| Very clear| It does not go to the edges of the phone and mine is lifting up a little bit because of this| But overall great product|
positive,4,I found this product to be everything it said it would be| It is in my purse and has not suffered scratches from keys| pens| etc| My only complaint is that it could be a tad bigger| It doesn't comepletely cover my screen| But I would definitely recommend it|
negtive,3,I've bought a few Zagg shields in the past for other phones| always great| easily applied to phone| never crack or anything| This one did not go on my new phone as smoothly (Galaxy 7) AND the shield actually broke/shattered at one of the edges| no idea how|
negtive,1,I bought this| took it back|| I got told I only had 15 days of purchase| $53 for this screen protector and $8 to put it on| NEVER AGAIN|| I am going to cancel my membership|| No way am I going to spend money there again||
positive,5,I was hesitant about using the glass protector as opposed to the screen protector that came with my OtterBox I went ahead and applied it which was very easy it covers the screen nicely and does not inhibit the touchpad screen
positive,5,I purchased this item bc i had something similar on my last phone| The shield was super simple to put on and it hasnt moved since| It keeps my phone protected and it hasnt shown signs of peeling or anything like that| Will recommend product and brand|
negtive,1,The screen protector doesn't quite fit right| The edges of the s7 screen are slightly curved and the protector is totally flat| I got it only a few weeks ago and its already cracked| Waiting for the proper fitting screen protector to come out before I replace it|
positive,5,The best part of this product was the small additional fee I paid to have it installed| The Best Buy sales person puts them on all the time and she installed mine in record time with no bubbles| alignment errors or other common problems|
negtive,2,Annoying prism effect on edges| Item cracked after less than 3 weeks| and I did not drop the phone| A warranty replacement will cost $5 for shipping| and I don't want another glass one| so have ordered a set of plastic ones|
positive,5,Zagg is my go to screen protector for all of the phones I've had and it's the one I recommend to family and friends| With free lifetime replacement for as long as you have the device| it's a great deal so just spend the extra money on it in the beginning|
negtive,2,Previous Zagg glass were awesome| This one didn't fit the slight radius left/right edges on the S7| Left an annoying 1/16' strip not adhered| took less than a week to get caught| and I removed it| The S7 is durable with out it|
positive,4,I like the overall protection and warranty| but really wish Zagg could figure out how to get the protector to cover ALL of the screen including the curved edges| I already have a small crack on the edge of my screen at the edge of the ZAGG shield|
positive,5,Have used Zagg protectors before| Great product| Perfectly clear and easy to apply| Purchased online late one evening and picked it up at a local Best Buy the next day after work| It was on sale that week| so that was an extra bonus|
positive,4,This is designed to prevent glass scratches or breakage saving you hundreds of dollars in repairs or replacement| Best part is if you damage it LIFE TIME WARRANTY just register it on line| That in itself will save you money in the future|
positive,4,Best screen protection you can buy| My only "negative" comment is the halo around the edge of the phone| It doesn't really stand out or anything but it does appear to ever so slightly degrade the touch sensitivity around the left and right edges but it's not bad
negtive,3,I always get a screen protector for my phones and| so far| I'm vey happy with the quality of protection this screen protector has given me| It's hardly noticeable| made of quality material| adheres well| and smudges wipe clean easily with a soft cloth|
positive,5,Wonderful little item that not only would I recommend| but suggest that you pay the Geek Squad to put it on ($8|00)||| The first one they did had some air bubbles| so they broke open a new box and did it again| Not an option when you try it yourself!
negtive,2,we just recently got our phones/ put the Zagg shield on it and my husband's already broke| i understand we can send it back and get a new one| FREE| but it's a hassle to have to do that already and then to put it on again| so far mine is ok|
positive,5,The process of putting this on was actually pretty easy| I've used other brands that would be off or short and wouldn't cover the whole screen| I've been using these for a while and it really does help the protection of the screen|
negtive,1,Very disappointed with this product| edges of glass do not lay flat on screen| Was told this at store once it was put on| all Zagg S7 shields fit like that| Returned it immediately! Have always purchased Zagg shields and first issue with the product|
positive,5,Always trust Zagg products| protection you can trust| I have purchased other brands in the past but have come to the conclusion on investing in buying Zagg products first| I no longer buy other brands of any type of screen protection| it's a waste of money|
positive,4,Love the glass protector| Although I did have to have the first one replaced as it wasn't properly adhered to the phone and it cracked| Best Buy replaced it as it was only a day old| New one adhered properly has has kept my phone screen in good shape|
positive,5,I dropped my phone down a flight of wood stairs| It bounced three times| The screen protector cracked in 3 places| but the screen underneath was left completely unscathed| Excellent product| I replaced with the same product because it worked so well
positive,5,I recently purchase a Samsung Galaxy S7 I bought the screen protector with it because the Best Buy associate suggested it she also installed it for me and told me about the lifetime warranty it was a great purchase and I definitely recommend it
positive,4,Helps protect your screen very well| Dropped my cellphone several times and protected it better than my expectations| It eventually cracked but helped out a lot| Still using it need to use the warranty to get another one| Very satisfied with the product|
positive,5,I got this screen protector from Best Buy about a month ago and I am really please with it| It is invisible on the phone and it has made my phone look like a new phone| I have dropped is a couple times and no hint of any damage|
negtive,2,Have always been impressed with Zagg but not this time| Appears they rushed a product to market| Halo effect with the flat protector is an visual issue along with a great dust/crud gatherer| Your pockets will stay clean because this thing collects all of it|
positive,4,First one I got for a Galaxy S7 (not an Edge) did not stick down at edges| Could not return to Best Buy and after two tries talking with Zagg| they admitted that it was a design flaw and sent a new one at no charge| Seems to be OK now|
negtive,2,This was my third purchase for this phone| Not happy with quality of product or difficulty of getting replacement| Salesperson says "at least screen didn't crack"
negtive,1,Does not fit the phone (Samsung S7)| Edges does not adhere to the sides of the phone causing dust and debris to get stuck|| Best Buy associate that installed it said that the first ones that come out are not made to size| Need to return and get one that fits|
positive,5,The Zagg Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector is easy to apply| unlike the old Zagg protectors where one had to spray the phone or tablet first| It does not seem to interfere with touch response| and is a quality product| I do not regret purchasing this|
positive,5,The HD clarity of the screen protector goes well with the HD quality of the phone|I am happy with the guarantee that is associated with the replacement of the screen protector if any defects may occur| I would recommend this product to all my friends|
negtive,1,This screen protectors "fit and finish" if very poor| it does not fit tight to the screen leaving an air gap around the border| which not only looks like bad but allows dust to make its way under the screen protector and the phone|
negtive,1,The edge of the S7 is slightly curved| the Zagg is flat| I have already cracked 2 in less than a month| until they get it to fit properly on the screen I would not buy| I do have the lifetime but cmon I don't want to replace it every couple of weeks?
negtive,3,It works good| but the outer edge of the shield doesn't stick| so it looks like a frame when the phone is not on| When the phone is on| you don't notice the edges| I asked the samsung rep and he said it was a known issue by samsung but they all do this|
positive,4,These glass screen protectors are nice| They are pretty fragile though| I have already replaced it once after a week| Replacements are free as long as you register your screen protector with the company on their website| The clarity of them are good|
positive,5,This is actually a replacement after my last protector broke| but lets just say that it totally saved my phone| Its way better to replace this cracked screen protector rather than replacing a $700 phone! Money well spent
positive,5,I dropped my phone| it appeared my phone cracked in the corner top as well as bottom| 3 cracks in all| I was freaking out and then I peeled the screen saver off and my phone is perfect| Love it
positive,5,Perfect fit and full coverage of the screen but a little difficult to apply -- I had the store clear install it because they've done hundreds| It would not be easy for a first time install| Easy to wipe clean and has not scratched at all|
negtive,3,This screen protector installed extremely easy| but because of the beveled edges of the screen it won't lay flat| I called the company and they are aware of the issue and are working on a fix| They will send a new one when they are ready for free|
negtive,2,I've always protected my phone with these screen protectors| This time on our new S7s| they don't fit right||they are lifted from edges| when I took back to store all they suggested was to exchange with the darker so it couldn't be seen| Not cool!
negtive,2,Two thick lines remain on both sides of the phone| they do not interfere when the screen is brilliant| however| they are very noticeable when the screen is off or with low bright| It seems to do its function well|
positive,5,I always have the Zagg protective shield installed on my phone to keep the original glass screen pristine| It doesn't interfere with your 'touch' screen sensitivity| This is the best company of all the companies that make protective shields|
positive,4,It does the job| The fit isn't great| but I guess that is to be expected when you get the phone before it is released to the public| At some point| I will send it back for a better fit| but as always| it does a great job protecting an expensive investment|
negtive,2,Ive had 2 of these protectors in less than a year| 2nd was purchased few weeks ago&already cracked! Also there is some weird halo effect going on around the sides of the screen| I'm super easy on phones so this product just sucks!
positive,4,I read all the reviews| and this seemed like the best screen protector| even though it was the most expensive| It was a little tricky to put on| but I finally got it done| It doesn't show fingerprints| and doesn't add a lot of weight to my phone|
positive,4,This is the second new phone that I have used zagg the first phone it worked great and had to replace it and zagg shipped it right out no charge the stand behind there products and that why I got 2 more 1 for my new phone and 1 for my wife phone
positive,5,I've always had very good luck with all the Zagg screen savers I have purchased| They have replaced some in the past no cost to me so I'll keep coming back| The one on my last phone cracked but saved the phone screen so it did it's job|
negtive,1,The screen protector did not stick to the edges of my s7| The employee apllied two protectors but neither stuck to the edges leaving a halo around the outside of my phone that causes the touchscreen not to work on the edge| Useless!
positive,5,When I purchased my new phone and case| the Best Buy clerk suggested I get a glass screen cover| Great suggestion! It cleans easily| doesn't scratch| and doesn't distort what is on my phone| Thank you| Best Buy| for pointing me in the right direction!
negtive,1,Let me say I love ZAGG screen protectors and have them on every single screen device I have| Bought this and on the very 1st day it suffered a small crack| Now after 2 months it has 3 small cracks on it| Will be requesting a replacement soon|
positive,5,I got this for my daughter and it broke after 6 months| But my daughter is rough on her phone so that was expected| However| her phone screen did not crack||| and they replaced the protector for free| so this was a win win situation| Very pleased!!!
positive,4,Glass cracked and zagg replaced however your responsible for 5|99 shipping and must register| Easy exchange process| Glass cracked due to pressure| Son laid his head on purse in shopping cart| and somehow pressure cracked glass| Other than that happy|
positive,5,We purchased this screen protector because the previous one on the phone did not fit very well| it was cheap and from a different manufacturer| So far| this one looks great | visibly clear| and no bubbles underneath
positive,5,Have I dropped the phone with this screen protector on? Yes| Did it completely protect the phone screen and only crack the screen protector? Yes| Does it have life time warranty? You bet| It just works|
negtive,3,This is my second shield in less than a year| I paid best buy both times to put it on but the first time was poorly installed| So it got dirty and finally fell off| So far| this one id better| Does crack easily but better than the screen|
positive,5,My wife's phone was protected by one of these| Over a period of a year| it took a beating and cracked; the phone screen| however| was undamaged| We just applied a new one to the same phone|
positive,5,i dont know how many times i have dropped my phone and the screen never cracks just the protecter breaks but i had it registered and they sent me a new one right away
negtive,1,expensive and boyfriend cracked the side of it while putting it on| Although even with that is has protected my phone screen ever since| I did get a glass sliver in my finger from a piece of the screen that came off which was NOT cool
negtive,1,I've now returned 3 Zagg glass covers for my S7 and the protectors do not fit well|Do not buy this product - it was not designed nor engineered well and is not worth it|Zagg did not account for the slight curvature of the screen on the S7|
negtive,1,I prefer the Invisible HD Screen protector I am accustomed to and returned this glass| I found that it tended to pop up/bubble at the edges| It seems to have trouble staying secured because of its rigidity| unlike the flexible Invisible HD shield
positive,4,This is a nice screen protector; it's very clear and cleans nicely| My only complaint is that I've found that it takes a little more pressure when typing since this screen protector is a little thicker; it's just a slight re-learning process|
positive,4,I have had these screen protectors on several phones| All have cracked or broken within two weeks of application| But the phone glass is not broken which is why I have the protector on| So it's doing its job and Zagg has a lifetime replacement policy|
negtive,3,I would not recommend putting this on yourself| Maybe with practice these are easy to put on but I would definitely pay someone to do it for you| Other than that the functionality of it and quality is great|
positive,5,I've tried a lot of different screen protector products| but Zagg tempered glass protectors are the only ones that have never failed me| I'm hard on phones this product with its lifetime warranty is the best accessory that you can buy for your phone|
positive,4,Seems to be a great item but install it carefully| Too much pressure will cause cracks| Corners are the most sensitive areas| The plastic screen protectors might be a better buy for the money| Will be good item for a phone|
positive,4,This one doesn't fit the Samsung S7 exactly right but it definitely protected my screen| When I had to replace it I tried another brand that fit better and cost less| Fail| I lost screen sensitivity so I had to buy the Zagg one again|
positive,5,Ever since I discovered Zagg it's been the only screen protector I use on my mobile devices| I've even introduced my husband to the Zagg screen protector and he's as pleased as I am with the product| I have recommended it to all my friends|
positive,5,I purchased this on my daughters recommendations to go with her new phone| I was a little skeptical at first because of it being glass| but once it was installed| I was so happy I did get it| Its a great feature to add to her phone
negtive,3,Zagg needs to redesign this screen protector to curve with the glass of the Galaxy7| Current model leaves edges exposed| allowing for dust & particles to get under| The part of the screen covered is great & allowing for lifetime warranty is fantastic|
negtive,2,About an 1/8" to 1/4" of the protector along the entire left and right side of protector does not fully adhere to the screen| The protector does not appear to match contour/profile of the standard S7 phone screen|
positive,4,The protector has worked well so far| but the rounded edges of the screen have made it difficult| Even with the phone case| the protector chipped the first time I dropped it| Still keeps my phone safe though| And I love the lifetime warranty|
negtive,3,Not sure why this cracked| I went back with my receipt to exchange and was very disappointed in the service received| Apparently this is warrantied but I have to pay shipping for it| That will add up especially since this cracked after 3 weeks|
negtive,3,This is a great product in that it covers the entire screen and is glass 9H| However| the adhesive is only around the edges and does not adhere to the entire screen| This can interfere with some of the touch sensitivity|
positive,5,Bought screen saver at Best Buy in mall| Young lady that helped me removed the old screen saver and attached new screen saver as I watched| Very thankful for her doing everything for me rather than me messing it up|
negtive,1,Purchased 3 of these when upgrading the family's phones| All of them were cracked within 6 months of purchase and the company wants to charge ~$6|00 for shipping of each|
positive,4,No bubbles and enhances view on my Samsung phone| Fits fine| Installed for me by Best Buy| Took off one star because it was pricey and I think I have to push a bit harder to text|  Happy with the purchase|
negtive,1,We purchased two of these and they do not stick around the edge| There was a 2-3 mm unsealed edge around the entire screen protector| After asking around| we learned that it is an issue that Zagg is aware of| Best Buy offered a full refund|
positive,5,I have always bought ZAGG shields| They are guaranteed for life| I have had to replace some in the past for breaking (but NOT the phone) and pealing|||great service from the company| I even had one I forgot to register and they still replaced it|
positive,5,I was worried about my touch screen being ruined by my grandchildren| and bought this because of the recommendations and life time warranty|It was easy to apply| there are no "bubbles" under the screen and the touch screen works as it always has|
positive,5,Zagg - Invisibleshield Glass Screen Protector For Samsung Galaxy S7 is easy to apply| very intuitive to touch| offers self healing technology| Fits screen well| smudge resistant| and offers excellent clarity| Highly recommend this product!
positive,4,I believe in screen savers as I plan to keep this expensive new phone for a long time| The edge is barely noticeable| I notice no difference in phone usability| I am pleased with everything except the very high cost of this screen saver|
negtive,1,It doesn't fit completely over the phone making texting/inputting full of errors| I was told the "halo" would improve but it hasn't| Would like to know if I can get my money back| Not worth the cost but definitely not worth the aggravation|
positive,5,I Love Zagg shields| I don't buy any devices without buying a Zagg shield| They protect the screen from getting damaged and their replacement warranty is worth the purchase| I have had to replace a few screen protectors and it's an easy process|
negtive,1,All of the reviews are correct| The glass does not fit the slight curve of the screen| leaving the sides unattached| A simple catch on anything in my wife's purse will rip the glass off| Horrible design|
positive,5,This is the second time I have purchased this for a phone| They are great| Still touch sensitive but protect the screen from shattering| Have otterbox| but dropped phone on pointed object| The glass shield cracked| but no injury to phone
positive,4,I love these screen protectors| Mines coming off a bit already I'm not sure if it's from being put on wrong or not but other than that these are great to have| Saves me so many times when dropping my phone on concrete floors at work|
positive,4,Zagg has been a great product for my family in the past| The edges of the screen protector chip away easily| I guess it is better the protector than my phone screen| The protector is easy to install and i have a clear view of my screen|
positive,4,I bought this for my last phone (Galaxy Note 5) and it saved me from having to replace the screen| Old phone took quite a beating from 3 young boys| but I peeled off the screen protector & the screen looked brand new|
negtive,1,Zagg should not have come out with this project| It did not fit and left a horrible fog around the edge| I love Zagg Products| but this one came to the market too fast| Get the new updated curved glass| It fits perfect and does not break as easy|
negtive,3,I'm not to happy with this product| The whole screen saver cracked in half after 3 months| I'm very careful with my phone| This shield comes with a lifetime warranty which is great because I'll be calling for my 3rd screen within a year|
positive,5,Easy application| My 7 year old even commented on how smooth it feels on the screen| Prevents scratches well| I have dropped my phone a few times and this prevented any damage that could have occurred|
positive,4,It is a quality product but I am having some problems with the touch recognition on the outside edge because the Samsung Galaxy S7 screen wraps / is beveled| The screen protector does not sit flush on the phone around the outside edge|
negtive,3,I always buy a screen protect with the purchase of a new phone| Zagg has always been my first choice when it comes to screen protectors| This protector is ok| but it doesn't fit securely on the sides of the screen| That's my only grip|
positive,5,Having a glass shield on my cell phone is a must| I have used this product on all of my cell phones and it definitely is worth the cost| It not only is added protection but it is easy to clean the many fingerprints it gets on a daily basis|
negtive,3,Broke after first day| I payed 40 for it at 8pm the next morning I wake up and it was all ready cracked| It nice if u can keep it that way| Every one I know that has one there's I broken as well| It nice my screen is buffered but it seems cheap
negtive,1,Didnt even drop it| i layed on it in hoodie pouch| edge chipped| Took it to customer service to return and it broke in half when i removed it| Then Best Buy refused to refund| threw 40 bucks in the garbage| DO NOT BUY
negtive,1,The middle of the glass screen looks great| just like every other glass screen made by zagg| Unfortunately| the edge is awful as it is curved and the glass doesn't adhere| Will be returning as the fit is bad|
negtive,1,I just brought this product 2 months ago and it's already damaged| It has a few small cracks on the edge of both sides which eventually caused a crack line across the screen protector| It suppose to be a strong product| but it's not|
positive,4,I always opt for a quality screen protector and a cheap| fun case| ZAGG didn't fail me on a Galaxy 5 for 2 years| and so far this one is holding up as well| Only complaint: the edges are peeling up a bit on the sides|
positive,4,This is also very good protection for your cell| The only negative I have is that I sometimes have to poke my finger on the screen pretty hard for it to be sensed by my touch screen| Other than that| it is a good protector|
positive,5,I purchased this guard for my new phone| Nice and crystal clear| while offering maximum protection to the glass front of my phone| Came with a lifetime guarantee from the manufacturer| I had the Best Buy employee attach it for me| Great job!
negtive,2,I've had two of these now| each one chipping on alternate sides within a day or two of applying| My wife has the same phone and same screen protector with no issues| Zagg does offer replacement but it shouldn't chip within a day|
negtive,1,This screen protector is designed to go on a flat screen| and does not work on the S7| It sticks up around the edges| and cracks constantly| I'm on my second one in a little over a month| and it already has a chip in the corner|
negtive,2,I didnt like this one because it broke after 2 weeks and 1 little drop| I had a protective case too| But zagg replaced with better one| So i liked that| I would recommend the brand but not that certain screen|
positive,4,The screen protector is easy to keep clean and it does keep my phone screen from getting scratched| It was a little challenging to put on w/o air bubbles appearing on the screen|
positive,5,I have a work phone that is touch screen BlackBerry| and my experience with that is to say| eh| But my Galaxy 7 Edge is quite easy to use| I like the fact you can set your favorite's such as contacts or apps on the "edge" which makes quick use|
negtive,2,The screen protector doesn't fit the screen as it should| i was in contact with Zagg and it is a known problem| Zagg themselves has pulled the product from their site for sale until it is fixed| I wonder why Best Buy continues to sale it|||
negtive,3,I'm still up in the air with this screen protector I've had zagg products in the past but this particular protector already cracked the first week I got my phone| I just got the replacement so I'll cross my fingers in hopes this one will work|
positive,4,This has held up well in the past month| it is a must have for the line of work I do on locomotives| but so far it has withstood many things| I messed up putting it on so there is one little bubble| but other than that has been working great|
positive,4,I always get Zagg screen protectors| They do a fantastic job of protecting| However| there seems to be a region that doesn't adhere to the screen along the edge| It's about 1/16" wide| Not distracting though|
negtive,2,Because of the natural curve on the edges of my Galaxy S7 this screen protector kept cracking and breaking while in my pocket due to no support on the edges I went through 6 these in one month not a good buy for this device
positive,5,My only issue -- and it's certainly not this glass cover for my phone -- but the darn things get so messy with fingerprints| Seems I am constantly wiping it clean| But that's all glass protectors so I'm really not complaining|
positive,4,Best buy had wrong price @ registerThey correctedProduct is great| Great warranty|Fit the screen well| Easy to install| Best buy wanted a lot to install| Do it yourself|
negtive,3,Within a month| the screen saver was starting to come off| My husband had his replaced already| My last screen saver lasted a year before showing sign of wear and tear| For $40| I'm not thrilled| but I know the alternative is worse|
positive,5,I've always believed in the ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector| It it definitely made for the intent of protection of the phone| I've dropped my phone several times| and the Invisible Shield does its' job|
positive,5,Does the packaging say invisible? I think it does| That's because it is||| invisible! The perfect addition to my phone| No issues with it at all| Can't tell you how many times this has saved my screen| A great product!
negtive,2,The product scratches very easily| Within 2 week and just leaving the glass on my dresser it obtain marks within the glass| The glass is still intact and overall protects the phone but the screen is not as good as quality for the price paid|
positive,4,I wanted something that I could easily position without air bubbles| and easily remove when needed| This one has all those features and a free warranty|
negtive,1,Bought this for my new Galaxy s7| After purchasing it and having Best Buy install it| it would not lay down on the edges because the s7 screen curves down slightly on the edges| Took it back however and they refunded it no questions asked|
positive,5,I absolutely love this screen protector| It glides real smooth when swiping| it cleans up super easy| it provides no glare or reflection| and it hasn't broken yet even though I drop my phone every once in a while|
positive,4,This is a great product| The sales rep put it on the phone for me| Unfortunately| they charge a fee to do this| but she did a great job making sure there were no air bubbles|
positive,4,Glass cover cracked within first few months of use- A fantastic plus is that the product holds true to its warranty I registered the product and ZAGG sent me a brand new one in the mail- All I had to do was mail back the cracked one|
positive,4,2 other Samsung owners recommended this product to me & now I will join to recommend to others| A lifetime warranty will make sure your screen remains intact| Worth the extra fee to have Best Buy do the install|
positive,5,It does the job of protecting my screen glass very well| No problems or complaints| Also| it seems easier to clean fingerprints and smudges than the original glass that came on the Samsung Galaxy S7|
positive,5,But| if a halo doesn't bother you then i would recommend this| I hated the rubber one I had on my old phone| This HD glass protector has great picture and actually feels like you are using the screen on your phone|
negtive,2,The overall shape of the glass is correct| however the edge of the phone tapers off| The Zagg glass is prone to crack around the edges| this is now my 2nd Zagg screen for the S7 and it is already cracking|Zagg has been informed|
positive,4,Only complaint is that the shield does not rest completely on the edge to the phone| There is a seal for the shield but about 1/4 in on the left and right sides and 1/8 in on the top and bottom that it doesn't adhere to the phone|
positive,4,The screen protector is a little thicker than other ones I have had in the past| but seems to work just fine| It probably offers more protection than some of the thinner ones out there|
positive,5,I wasn't sure about buying this when my salesman showed it to me but I'm glad I did| Adds to the water resistency of the phone and it was inexpensive| Request price match for a lower price
positive,5,Should have gotten this from the start| Phone cracked with another screen protector| but this one does a good job and comes with lifetime warranty|
positive,5,I have one from a previous phone purchase| Good product| My problem is that Best buy suggested this for a new phone purchase| It does NOT fit a galaxy J7| It was suggested to buy at check out so we did and we had to return it|
negtive,2,After replacing my s7 I searched for a screen protector and decided on this one| Within 4 hours the screen was cracked| I does not fit fully on the screen| I think that is why it cracked to easily|
negtive,1,Could barely see my screen in the sun with this| was like a hazy residue underneath| Then a few days later the shield just uplifted| peeled off and cracked in multiple areas during that process| Don't waste your money on this product|
positive,5,I have used many Zagg products and this one is no different than the rest| It's always well worth the purchase especially considering that the warranty is for life| I would highly recommend the product for all your electronic products
positive,4,Product is great|||comes with a warranty| Only problem is that mine has little cracks along the side| because it doesn't contour exactly to the phone| This is ultimately not a big deal and is still worth the $|
negtive,3,It's just ok| I had it put on at the store| It doesn't sit right on the s7 and has air pockets on each side| It also got a small Crack the first day|||I didn't drop it or anything| I guess at least my phone screen isn't cracked|
negtive,3,Zagg quality has gone down since last time I bought| This does not fit/cover the screen good| It got scratches on it right away just by typing on the phone| i have no nails| never in pocket or purse|
positive,5,The rubbery protection started developing bubbles and didn't look good| This looks like a seamless glass cover| Hopefully will stand the test with a teenager|||||
positive,4,I will never use a plastic screen protector again| On a clean screen| it was super easy to apply| Because it's glass| it's really easy to get air bubbles out as it doesn't flex| Plus| it feels the same as the screen|
negtive,3,I had it installed at the store| it has this weird halo effect on the outer edges| The lady who installed it said that's how it's supposed to look| but it's gotten worse in a week| IDK may try something else next time|
positive,5,I have had a hard time with cell phones| I never wanted to pay for a screen protecter and I pai the price by having my nice phones look horrible from scratches| This Zagg screen protecter has kept my phone scratch free and looking good!
negtive,2,I highly recommend staying away from this product| Does not adhere to outer edges of screen| (halo effect) and Best Buy| slash Geek Squad charges $8 to put it on| when it's $39 to begin with!
positive,4,The product works as advertised| When I placed it on my phone it went on slightly to the side and I wasn't able to move it|This has kept it from fully sticking to the phone| Make sure you put it on straight!
positive,4,Based on everything that I had read concerning this screen protector| I wasn't sure if I was going to like it| I purchased it knowing about the halo affect so I can't complain about that and everything else appears to be fine|
positive,5,This shield protector is one of the most amazing things I've ever encountered| It literally deflected a nail gun nail and left the phone screen intact without a nick or a scratch and possibly prevented me from getting injured|
positive,4,The shield works well preventing my S7 from cracks| Came unglued at edge glad I paid $$ for it to be replaced| that saved me big $$| Only drawback is you have to tap the screen harder and sometimes multipule times|
positive,5,I just love this clear glass shield on my phone||My fingers just glide easily across the screen||and the appearance is enhanced by its clarity| making my phone much easier to read do my business
positive,5,The zag screen cover is great| I dropped my phone face down on a concrete floor| and and it wasn't damaged at all| That being said| the price was pretty high for the product|| plus Best Buy charged to install it|
positive,5,This shield is great for protecting your phones glass from shattering| I see so many phones that have cracked glass on them| I actually dropped my phone| which I never do| and the shield cracked not my phone| It is truly a phone saver|
positive,5,Great product| I bought it for my teenage son that continually drops his phone and while the product cracked| it protected the phone| I believe they will also send you a new one if you are registered|
positive,5,I had Zagg sheilds on phonmes in the past and appreciated the way they prevented finferprints and smudges| This HD Glass version is even better as it adds a thicker layer that protects the scrren to a greater degree
negtive,1,was told it was the best| unfortunately the product was the opposite for me| gave the product a week to "settle"/"form" on the edges of phone| screen lifted on both outer edges of phone instead of the latter|
positive,4,This screen protector is overall pretty good| The only problem is that it doesn't curve with the edges of the galaxy s7 screen| which leaves an unattached 1/8" section on both sides| But to me that's not a big issue|
positive,5,The invisible shield is of great quality| It is easily applied to the screen| even by a novice| It is clear and provides good visibility to your phone screen| It has provided amazing protection to my phone screen/
negtive,1,definitely not thrilled with the way this fits the phone!! it does not cover the entire screen therefore leaving a gap and the edges don't stay sealed to screen| It was a waste of money for me as I ended up just taking it off
positive,5,We never buy a phone without having a Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector installed before we leave Best Buy| They do a great job of installing it and the Shield does a great job of protecting the screen of your new phone|
positive,4,Pleased with this for the most part| Only thing I dislike is the sides don't stay down completely| That might be due to operator error upon putting the protector on the phone (did it myself)| But it's not too bad| Overall| a good buy|
positive,5,My wife is rough with her phone| Needless to say this replacement is worth it rather than paying for the phone replacement or repair that would have happened if it hadn't been there| Nice save!
positive,5,As expensive as phones are| I feel like I can't afford to not protect the screen| Although a bit pricey| this screen protector fits the bill| and has a warranty should it ever be damaged or fail| I would definitely recommend!
positive,4,I have always put zagg glass protectors on all of my phones| and they have always kept my screen in mint condition| Even though it leaves a slight border on both sides of the screen due to the new design| It still protects the phone|
negtive,3,Looks great when you first install it| but it cracks very easy and looks bad| They say they will will replace it but what a pain to go through there process| I would rather buy another brand and get on with my life|||
positive,5,This protection has saved the screen on my phone from damage many times| It is much better to damage the protector than damage the touch screen| Best Buy is truly THE BEST! GREAT support and the Geek Squad is truly World Class|
positive,5,I always choose Zagg not only for their reliable product| but for the awesome lifetime warranty that goes with it| If the glass screen cracks| simply contact them for a replacement| You pay shipping only| Can't beat that!
negtive,3,The glass protector received cracks in it pretty easily| only had for 2 months| I will be sending back to replace not sure how well the process will go yet| Will only recommend as a result of the ease of replacing for a new one|
negtive,3,Have always used Zagg screen protectors| Great warranty and customer service| This particular screen protector however doesn't go with the curvature of the screen very well though| Not a big deal when you have a case though
negtive,2,It seemed easy enough to put on and is clear and has no problems with the touch pad working| but in trying to get out a bubble (as per the instructions) the edge shattered| Will try to get another|
negtive,3,Works fine but I feel that I have to put extra pressure around the sides and bottom when using keyboard or any touch function| Samsung S7 is beveled around the screen edges so I feel they could make a protective screen to match|
positive,5,I purchased this product to protect my phone as I had broken the screen on my last phone| This phone fell from counter height striking the base of a stool| The Zagg cracked| but my screen didnt|(new Zagg on my phone now)
positive,5,This was a replacement purchase| When i contacted Zagg I received excellent service and they replaced the replacement with no shipping charge because of the issue| I originally purchased the replacement at Best Buy|
positive,5,Although the Zagg screen protectors are quite expensive they are well worth the money| My phone inevitably hits the ground at least a half dozen times a week| but with my Zagg protection I have never had a screen shatter|
negtive,3,We went through several of these before finally giving up| Just the slightest little jar would begin to crack the screen protector| It did protect the screen but we had to go back to the store to exchange every week or 2|
negtive,2,Very expensive for a single piece| but this is what my daughter wanted| Did not fit the S7 (normal) very well|||the edges were not tight| It will work which gets a star| but sheesh| no|
positive,5,This is my second screen protector| Great at protecting from dirt and scratches| There's a "halo" on the edges on my S7 (not the Edge)| but combined with a protective case| it's saved my phone numerous times| A must have for sure|
positive,4,I am sure there are cheaper options out there| but it was for my teenage son's phone and I needed something I knew would work well| We have had for a couple months so far and several drops late it's still staying strong|
negtive,1,doesnt grip the edges| put on 2x by geek squad and the product is not what it should be for the price|||already cracking at the top and by the menu button with no dropping of the phone
positive,4,I had it installed by Geek Squad when i bought it| Within an hour the very edges on the sides came up about 1/16" in from the outside edge| A few chips have come off since then| Phone has been in a case since i bought it
positive,4,This is a replacement purchase| The 1st one had many cracks| I was leaning toward a different screen protector but this was the only one available in store| It was over half off so I'm giving it a second chance|
positive,5,Bought two for our new S7s| Think the product is better than the earlier vinyl version we had on our LG G2s|| Bought another one for the S2 Galaxy Tablet| So easy to put on| I did it myself and avoided GEEK Squad costs|
negtive,1,Bought mine about a month ago and it has already starting developing pit marks| The edges are coming off| They want me to pay for another one so the warranty is useless! Wasted my money on this one| No more Zagg for me|
positive,4,The samsung phone is curved and the edges of the screen protector don't stick down and is mildly annoying| Its like a ring around the collar| But after a few days - you wont even notice anymore|
positive,5,This glass screen protector was highly recommended by the sales associate and after having it for more than two weeks now I can definitely say that it works great| It doesn't smudge and there are still no scratches|I like it|
positive,4,I like how the protector covers the original phone screen| However It is slightly larger than the screen and debris will collect on the edge of the screen| However I also could not register this product on its website|
negtive,3,This is the first Zagg product I have owned that doesn't fit right| It is too wide| and leaves a slight dead zone near the left and right edges| I'm almost hoping it comes off soon so I can replace it with another brand|
positive,5,I'm a klutz and the glass screen protector takes the hit instead of my phone| The only time it hasn't worked was when I was too lazy to put it on| Unlimited exchanges for $7 a piece included shipping|
positive,5,had trouble with previous protectors due to the curved edges of the screen| This protector does not extend all the way to the edge| so stays in place better and doesn't get pulled loose by a case|
positive,4,Zagg screen protectors are great| I only have one issue with this screen protector and that is it doesn't fit the screen correctly due to the curvature of the screen so the outside edges don't completely seal like they should|
negtive,1,I really did not like this product| Had it for a week & it had already cracked without me ever dropping it| Got it replaced and within 3 days it had cracked again| I just gave up at that point and asked for a refund|
positive,4,I liked the thickness of the shield| The reason I gave it a 4 star is it doesn't fit the Samsung Galaxy S7 properly| The edge of the phone curves and the shield does not bend| So to me it doesn't fit the phone correctly|
negtive,3,After getting one crack on the screen protector it has done a great job of protecting the screen on my phone| I like that it does not chip away when it does get broken into| it is pretty durable and reliable for the most part
negtive,2,I like the protection this screen protector offers but I do not like the bubbled edges| Maybe the associate that installed it simply put it on wrong| but it looks ugly with a lifted| bubbled look all the way around the edges|
positive,5,I have owned ZAGG protectors in the past and they were great then and remain great| The 7 has a slight roll on the long sides and unfortunately this protector doesn't exactly conform so there is a little gap down both sides|
negtive,3,I think I need a better phone case to protect the screen saver| I've purchased two of these and both of them have chipped when I've dropped the phone| But I think a phone case that protects it would help solve the problem|
negtive,2,Seems good| but is already popping off my screen| Edges don't go all the way down|| best buy employee who put it on said that's normal||| I don't know if it's an issue with the product or with the guy who installed it|
positive,5,Prior to getting the Zagg invisibleShield my 6 year old dropped the phone at minute maid park while watching you tube and not the Astros| The glass lens cracked| We are looking forward to the added protection for her new phone
positive,4,Yes| the glass protection breaks fairly easily with any drop of the phone but it beats your phone screen breaking| Love that it's life time warranty so when the screen does break| you can replace it for free!
negtive,3,Had an issue with screen shield cracking after fews days on phone| It wasn't dropped & not sure what caused it to crack on side of screen| Zagg was contacted & sending free replacement so going to try shield again!
positive,4,Only had protect screen about 2wks|||protect|screen alrdy has several chips on it |||it very clser doesnot tk away from phn screen |||easy to swipe|||great purchase|||wish would hv brought b4 i crack my phn screen
negtive,1,I hate these glass protectors| It easily chipped on the side| I'm going back to using wet apply screen protectors| I never had a problem with them
negtive,3,This was the only screen protector the store had available for my phone| It is very clear and you wouldn't know that it's there but mine developed a crack in the corner a day after it was put on (at the time of purchase)|
positive,4,With phones having so many uses in so many areas it is easy to put the phone in harm's way and therefore protection is needed to preserve the phone from damage| This helps…
negtive,1,Does not fit the S7| Edges did not get even close to sealing causing it shield to Crack on the edges on day 2 of minimal use| Also making it near impossible to use touchscreen on phone without great seal|
positive,5,I'd recommend using Geek Squad for placing shield on the phone after purchase but other than that this shield fits and works fine||| so far||| on my Samsung S7 phone! Fingers crossed when it drops!!
positive,5,Put this screen on a day after i got my phone||| the next day i dropped it and it bounced between my tool box and work bench before it hit the ground|| the cover screen spider-ed and saved my phone||well worth it
positive,5,My wife had this protector installed free over the glass of her phone at Best Buy| She loves it is so clear with no bubbles like with most screen protectors| You also get a lifetime warranty so you can't go wrong|
positive,5,I dropped my phone| the screen saver cracked in 2 places| I had registered it so it was 100% covered| Had a new screen cover in 48 hours| Best Buy charge $8 to put it on| Be sure to register your screen saver!
positive,5,I'll only purchase Zagg screen protectors! Best on the market| Lifetime warranty! Been using them since my Blackberry days| lol| Have it installed by a Best Buy employee to prevent frustration| ha| Great product| 5 stars!!
positive,5,I hesitated before buying a screen protector for my new phone| as earlier products were difficult to apply| This thing attached in seconds| with no troubles getting the "bubbles" out - and no debris under it!
negtive,3,Love zagg glass screen protectors| Only thing with this one is the phone is slightly curved on the edges & it's not an edge phone & it's the correct protector| Got a crack on the edge of the screen 1 week later
positive,4,The cost of 40 dollars seems excessive at first glance but when you realize if you register the product you can replacements cheap as heck| So if you have the money up front go for it!!! If not cheaper alternatives do exist
negtive,1,Huge fan of invisasheild glass however this one is not made for the phone and it's slight curve design (not its not for the edge) so there is lift on edges| So it doesn't have proper fit| I hope they redesign soon
positive,5,Invisishield Glass is fantastic! Have it on all my devices as well as my familys' devices! It has saved so much money in replacements for phones! If it cracks or any defect| will be replaced for free by the company!
positive,5,This is the best screen protector available| It is worth the money because if you happen to damage it| it is only $5 to replace instead of A)having to replace your phone or B) having to buy a whole new screen protector|
positive,4,This product is easy to apply yourself and gives your screen all around protection from side to side and top to bottom| Product is clear and easy to see thru and made thick enough for great screen protection|
negtive,3,This isn't well built for the Samsung Galaxy S7 because it doesn't sit correctly on the side due to how they angle| This causes it to look beveled| It's not a big deal| but a little annoying| It seems good otherwise|
negtive,3,Bought an open box| Had fuzz on protector that was not removable; therefore| recommend buying new and never removing until you are ready to replace|
negtive,1,The screen is curved a little bit and the screen protector is flat| Their for within a few days of installing the edges were all cracked!!! wish the associate would have mentioned that would happen|
positive,4,But the best thing about this glass breaking is that there's not gonna be a rattlesnake at the end of it| But for real| this glass is gonna break before the glass on your phone is gonna break| and that's its job| isn't it?
positive,4,Feels like nothing is on my screen which is great| Paid to have it installed and the guy at Best Buy put it on perfectly| Just a little expensive at $40 but I'm happy with it| Works well with my Tech21 clear case too|
positive,5,This was recommended by the Samsung rep when I got my Galaxy S7| I previously had another brand on my iPhone and could never see the screen in the sun just overall didn't like it - this one| however| I highly recommend!!!
positive,5,Worth every penny! Zagg is the best| dropped my phone a few times and screen was unscathed! Love Zagg's warranty- replace a scratched or damaged cover for life for the cost of shipping| cant beat it!
negtive,1,Bought the best cover for my new phone| was told there would be some Halo'ing around the edges|||didn't think it would look this bad|Sad| don't buy this expensive shield| buy the cheaper zagg for the GS7|
negtive,2,It was an ok screen protector not even for a week I got the galaxy S7 so needed a screen protector| Did a same day purchase| Screen Started to chip from the edges which I have not neglected the phone|
positive,5,Have been using this product for years and never have had a cracked screen| Accidents happen and the phone has been dropped and the shield has always protected the phone| I would not own a phone without this product|
negtive,3,Disappointed in this shield| My prevous Zagg shields have lasted me years| this one is already cracking along the edges| Purchased one for my daughter as well| and hers is also chipping and cracking along the edge|
positive,5,This is the best samsung cover| Others ive tried always have come off| Great protection| this has always kept the phone from cracking and scratching upon dropping and stays on great|
positive,5,My daughter told new about this product and how good it was on her IPhone | so I got one for my new S7 |so far so good| Could fit a little better| not as big as the screen itself| but with the case I got it works fine|
negtive,1,Edges don't stick to the screen and chiped on that area| scratches easily and all that in less then 30 days and this is the second one they put on because the first one had even a lager area it wouldn't stick to
positive,5,The Zagg screen protectors saved my last phone screen from shattering| so there was no question I would add it to my new phone| I recommend everyone gets one| because it's inevitable that you drop your phone!
positive,5,I like to place my phone in my back pocket| I like to know it has a shield on| This product works very well| A low priced insurance policy| Real clear and assures me my trade in value will be higher| A must have
positive,4,Good screen protector| I have not had any problems with scratches| cleans easily| Only problem I have had are little chips at the side because it does not curve to conform to the edge of my screen|
negtive,2,This product does not properly for the galaxy s7| I bought it and had it placed on by the store and it doesnt adhere to the side around the entire screen| It sometimes makes pushing enter or search and delete difficult|
negtive,3,Love zahgs products| first off| But on this particulas model for the GS7| the glass doeant bevel with screen| causing a halo on the edges| Second one in 1 month| Chips on edges where not beveled| Hope they correct this
positive,5,I have had e few of these on my phones and I have to say they are a screen saver! Went to a concert dropped my phone this protector broke and my phone didn't| Would have to say this is well worth buying|
positive,4,I have no complaints about my screen protector|I did have to get it replaced cause somebody dropped something on my phone a chipped it but it didn't harm my actual screen| It was replaced free| A great smooth surface|
positive,4,The protector is very clear| The protection is supposed to be good| I saw similar products work well on other phones| Having the lifetime warranty helps| since the protector is supposed to crack a lot when impacted|
positive,5,My daughter cracked her screen so this is more of Bandaid than a true protector but it is containing the crack so she can continue to use the phone until we can afford to replace it
positive,4,A little pricey especially at this that this for an S7 and Samsung is now on 9 I was anticipating some kind of discount| Mother than that it’s and very clear|
negtive,2,I've bought this twice on my s7 and both times it hasn't sealed properly on the sides||| I don't think it ever will for anyone| Dust gets in there and it's very grody and then it breaks easier on the sides|
positive,4,I do like how this product feels and cleans well due to the glass| Very durable but will crack with enough impact| Warranty comes with easy replacement just pay the shipping| Pretty easy to install as well|
negtive,1,This screen protector sticks up at the edges due to the slightly curved screen of the S7 (not edge)| Has already cracked up and down the sides of the screen protector on my device in less than a month|
negtive,1,Halo around the entire screen protector never went away| Started breaking a few days after I had the Best Buy employee place it| now in pieces and the adhesive is the only thing holding it together|
positive,5,I love having this screen protector!! Bought it because dust kept getting under the screen protector that was on my otter box case! Don't have that problem with this at all!!!! Would definitely buy again!!
negtive,2,Unfortunately the form factor comes up a bit short and allows the sticky edges of this screen protector to morph into a pocket lint and dust magnet and the lint cannot be removed as it becomes attached to the glue|
positive,4,It does its job to protect the screen and warranty replacement is super simple| Only reason for 4 stars is even though it is the right one for my phone the fit at the edges is not great|
positive,4,The shield attached to cell face as directed| Ended up buying an OtterBox to protect the cell phone from drops| Removed the glass shield as the screen sensitivity was somewhat reduced|
positive,5,36 hrs after we bought it| it was already protecting the brand new phone| My son hit it with a baseball| The shield showed the web like cracking| But it was only the protector| The only draw back? 1 in a box for $44|
negtive,1,I have used this one prior cell phones and it has always been great| sadly| the glass cover is slightly smaller than the actual screen area resulting in a lack of sensitivity at the left and right edges of the display|
negtive,1,Insalled by best buy on the day of purchase| Edges immediately cracked| Best Buy refused to take it back and had nothing better to replace it with| It was a completely adverse experience at Worst Buy|
negtive,3,It protects the screen| however| the side edges don't quite fit| The phone has a rounded edge and the screen doesn't| so it looks like it doesn't sit on the edge and makes it easy to crack| Mine cracked in my pocket|
positive,5,I love the glass screen protectors| but have always had the staff help me with installation| I ordered this online so chose to install it myself| It was super easy to do and looks like a professional did it ☻
positive,5,I always get these for my phones as I am prone to putting my phone into bags with loads of other things I carry around| They do a great job protecting the screen and the replacement policy is amazingly easy too|
negtive,3,This was the flat glass version| Even the regular S7 is slightly curved at the edges| This allows dirt to get under the edges| Zagg has a newer one that follows the edge at a higher price|
negtive,2,I ought this for my Samsung S8+| I wound up taking this back to the store because it started coming off of my screen| I don't think it works well with the curved screen| But it was easy to put on|
positive,5,Hands down| this is a must purchase for any cellphone| I've had it on my phone and dropped it| I thought my screen was shattered| but only the screen protector was shattered! Saved me from replacing a screen!
positive,5,I have dropped my S5 many times face down and the Zagg tempered glass shield saved the day|| When I bought my S7 once again I installed the Zagg tempered glass shield| it is the cheapest insurance you will ever buy|
positive,4,Great screen protector but because my galaxy s7's edges curve back slightly| the sides of the screen protector dont cover the side edges of the phone| Now theres lint collecting on the edges of my cell
positive,5,Bought it on the recommendation of the Best Buy sales associate| It has no negative impact on the performance of the phone makes me more confident that I won't trash my screen the next time I drop my new phone|
positive,5,A Zagg screen protector is always a go to for protecting a new phone or tablet| The screen protector might crack (& get replaced Free if you register it) but I've never had a device screen crack while using|
negtive,1,Was putting my phone in my pocket 3 days after buying this when (I think) it caught on the edge of my jeans and cracked it| I was out of the country at the time and couldn't return| Waste of money|||
positive,5,This screen protector is excellent; crystal clear ( you don't even notice it's there) and good protection: phone has been dropped a few times|and also fell out of the car holder|NO damage o the screen or cover|
negtive,3,Doesn't fit curved edges! Sticks to the phone better then others I've tried and seems to protect well but every edge is already collecting dust and dirt after only a few weeks|
positive,5,Looks Great! Very Clear| Replacement for Otter Glass from Costco| I dropped on tile floor & broke glass| Costco couldn't replace| Best Buy sold and the Samsung worker installed & did a great job|
negtive,1,This is a terrible product that does not function properly| Screen protector does not seal around the edges of the phone and allows for debris to get under the protector| Do not buy this product for the regular S7|
negtive,3,This is a good screen protector but the edges are not stuck down so I have to push harder when tapping near the edges| I'm not sure if the edges will pull up the whole screen after a time|
negtive,2,The screen does not fit the front of the phone with the proper curve around the edge which makes it difficult to type sometimes around the edges because it is not touching the phone| Very frustrating!!!
positive,4,I've used Zagg for every smartphone I've had and it's saved me so much money in phone screens| Warranty is true and easy to do| Seems to crack fairly easily but it protects your screen regardless|
positive,5,This was recommended​by the Best Buy sales associate and she installed it while I waited| It is much better than the plastic screen protector I was using| Feels like there is nothing on the screen|
positive,5,Love these screens| I have been using them for years| They are actually helpful| I have replaced them several times and customer service is excellent| They have undoubtedly saved my phone numerous times|
negtive,3,Very clear and does protect well| This is my second shield on this phone and I always end up with cracks on the shield within a week or two of installation without even dropping my phone| Not sure why?
positive,5,I always break my screens on my phone this case protected my phone for 1 year| I just replaced it since it was severely damaged and got another one| Love this case| highly recommended|
positive,5,My 60 lb puppy accidentally hit the phone with her paw knocking the phone out of my hand then accidentally stepping on it| The screen protector cracked but the phone's screen was intact
positive,5,I am really happy with the Zagg glass screen protector| The clerk put it on very quickly| and I can see well through it| Hopefully| it lasts for as long as I own the phone|
positive,4,The Galaxy S7 is a pain in the butt to fit screen protectors because of it's slightly tapered edges| This one covers almost to the edge| unlike many screen protectors| but it does not adhere at the edges|
positive,5,I love the clean and clear look that this protection offers and totally recommend this product to all who want to keep their screens protected snd looking like new
negtive,1,As all the other people have stated the product does not fit the phone|Best Buy should pull this product off of the shelf|
positive,4,Screen protector easy to apply and fits perfectly| On the bottom near the main phone button got caught on something and now there is a rough spot on the protector but it does not seem to be a problem|
negtive,1,Like so many others I can confirm the GLASS version of the screen protector does not fit correctly| The edges never make a seal and are a point of failure in the design| Do not buy|
positive,5,I always get a screen protector for my phones| The associate at Best Buy suggested it| He explained how durable the protector was| He showed me how the screen protector can cracked and you screen is protected|
positive,5,Had purchased a different glass protector for my Galaxy 8| Cheaper| and did it's job| Chipped and replaced with this Zagg| Can see and tell a difference| Thrilled! Good warranty benefits|
positive,5,They installed it on my phone amd informed me of warramty thru zagg and works great| dropped phone| screen protector cracked but screen was perfectly fine| Got replacement for $5 shippimg and handling
positive,5,I highly needed this in my life| knowing I dont want to get my screen messed up and I drop it and just had to replace the screen protector while my original screen has no damage to it|
positive,5,I bought this because Best Buy matches Amazon's prices as long as it shipped and sold from Amazon| The prices are great value for a lifetime warranty and it is saved my phone screen many times|
negtive,3,This screen protector was not as good as others I have purchased in the past| It was constantly bubbling and peeling of my phone screen| I eventually just took it off and purchased a better screen protector|
negtive,1,I usually love the glass shield protectors but with this phone being slightly curved the edges done seal and the phone protector breaks on the edges| Would not recommend glass protect for this phone|
positive,4,FYI| spend the extra money to get the curved glass model for the S7| It is not the one for the S7 curve| but still has a slight curve on edges| Chipped the straight model on the edge shortly after installing|
negtive,3,The glass shield cracked less than a week after it was applied to my phone| I contacted Zagg and they offered a replacement| I went with a non glass version since I didn't want to have to deal with a crack again|
negtive,1,After 6 days the edges are cracking don't now if it was installed wrong or it was defective| Went to a different Best Buy to have it exchanged but was told to go to the store I bought it at|
negtive,3,Never had a screen protector that didn't fit snug all the way to the outer edge of the phone| This one doesn't| which isn't the worst thing in the world|||hopefully it won't pose a problem|
negtive,3,I was told that the glass option of the protector would be the better option| It holds up well however you can see every scratch on it| unlike my previous vinyl ones| Plus| it does fit well along the edges|
negtive,1,This product is not good| The S7(yes not s7 edge) curves slightly at the edges while this screen protector is flat which causes it to flare around the edges and not lay flat on screen| Does not look good at all|
negtive,1,After 2 months of using my new phone with this protector| the shield has failed| I dropped my phone and the screen shattered|
positive,5,This is the best way to protect your phone's glass| I have broken my protective glass on other phones without issue to my phones actual glass screen and am so happy for the investment|
negtive,2,The screen protector was easy to apply| but it does not cover the whole screen| The beveled edge is not protected| The screen felt nice to the touch| but was not happy it didn't cover the whole screen|
positive,5,This screen protector is great| My grandson likes to play with my phone and no matter what he does it hilds up| It fits the screen well| I also had it installed at the store| Highly recommend that|
positive,4,Very Clear protection for the screen| Can't tell it's even there| except after having it for several months it has several fine cracks in it| Even those cracks are hard to see| Going to get it warrantied soon
negtive,2,I removed the glass screen protector after I got a case with one built in| Not for sure if it was the employee who put it on but it had a halo around the whole edge| Did its job just didn't like the halo
positive,5,The TV is working great| just the right size| The picture is great and it was easy to set up| I didn't like the storm taking out our old TV| but we are loving the new one| quite an up grade|
positive,4,Don't really know how to review this product since I haven't had it break| So so far so good| I have heard good things from ppl who have dropped their phone the protector broke and the screen was fine
positive,5,Protects the phone screen| I recommend this protection for anyone purchasing a phone| Do not have to worry about damaging the phone glass and ruining the phone at all| A great investment in an expensive phone|
negtive,2,Put the Zagg Glass screen protector on my new S7 and within 3 days it had two chips in it| The shield does not fit the phone properly and I would not recommend this product to anyone|
positive,5,Was able to find this product easily| and was installed quickly|It is replacing a plastic screen saver| This one is much smoother| and has already saved my phone several times!
negtive,2,The protector cracks/scratches way too easily| I mean I guess it technically does its job because my phone is still in one piece||| but it sucks that I still have huge cracks going across my phone|
positive,4,I have a 2 year old son| he has dropped my phone MANY times| There are two or three tiny little scratches on the shield now| No cracks| no damage to the phone| So not perfect| but a pretty darn good product!
negtive,1,Not made for the Samsung Galaxy 7| The phone screen is slightly curved and the glass sheild is not so it has a tendency to cracker| Supposedly they are making one to fit the phone| Until then we suffer|
positive,5,I was really impressed with the overall application method and experience while installing it| Screen fit perfectly with nice cutouts for camera hole| Case friendly too as I use a hard case|
negtive,1,The screen on the S7 is slightly curved at the edges| The protector is flat and started to crack at several places along the edges after only a couple of weeks| I replaced the protector with a case|
negtive,2,I put one of these on my phone and my wife's| Sadly it has a halo around the edges| I was told this was normal and should settle| It hasn't| Normally this brand is great| not so much for this phone|
positive,4,The Zagg glass shield for the Galaxy S7 is great| It does have that halo effect around the edges because the glass is sightly curves on the s7 but its still does its job and looks prettty good|
negtive,3,These screen protectors crack way too easily! The halo around the edges are kind of annoying! They do their job so your screen doesn't crack but really annoying to warranty them every month or so!
positive,4,I find this shield to work well on the Samsung Galaxy S7 phone| It is light weight so doesn't add bulk unlike the thicker glass shield I used on my old iPhone| It does exactly what it is supposed to do|
negtive,2,There is a small frame around all edges that does not secure to the phone so it's noticeable when phone is off| Geek squad installed said it's due to slight curve on edges of phone|
negtive,1,I've always used Zagg glass screen protectors and have always been happy|||until now| The screen protectors don't completely 'lie down' on the sides| leaving a gap that gathers lint| dust| etc| NOT HAPPY|
positive,5,I have always purchased Zagg screen protectors for my phones| This one is by far the best I have ever owned| Employees at Best Buy told me this one is the best and I agree| It is so easy to keep clean|
positive,4,The screen protector itself is good quality| but the edges have a long air strip along them because it doesn't fit quite right| It is worth it for how much nicer it is interacting with the phone|
negtive,2,Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Bubbles and lifts around the sides| my girlfriend and i both have the same Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass with the same problems
negtive,3,Was at first in love with the quality| but after only a week| the item chipped| I have a replacement on its way| but who knows how long that will last| For the price| I am not sure I would buy again|
positive,4,I like the way this product protects the screen on my Android| but I need to keep replacing it because cracks always develop| I have lifetime warranty| but must pay $7 for shipping each time|
positive,5,I have these installed on all of my phones and won't even use a new phone until it is added| I cannot say I drop my phone often but these definitely help protect the screen| I recommend these to everyone!
negtive,1,The phone has a natural curvature and the film would not lay flat and was lifted throughout all its edges| I will never buy this again| I didn't even get a week's worth of use| Waste of money|
negtive,3,Does the job| but after only 1 week the edges had cracks| Disappointed it is so touchy| Installing is also a pain and best buy charges you to add it to the phone for you| Works ok| could be better|
positive,5,Protect your Samsung Galaxy S7 device with this InvisibleShield glass screen cover| Featuring fortified tempered glass construction| this cover defends against scratches to extend your screen’s life
positive,4,My screen protector I had didn't cover the whole screen and made touching the edge very hard now I have this one that has the ever so slightly curve to match my phone and edge touching is how it should be
positive,4,This is my second one|It is protective but tends to take on cracks fairly easily|The phone screen itself does not get damaged| which is its purpose|
negtive,2,Not exactly sure what the issue is|||two attempts by sales person and mine still did not seal properly on edges and is already cracked on a corner without having been dropped or mishandled|
positive,5,This screen cover offers exactly whay I expect from Zagg: a very clear| durable screen protector at a reasonable price| I was pleased to purchase it and the salesman was kind enough to apply it|
positive,5,There is no contest| The Zagg glass screen protector is the best on the market| I have had it on a couple of my phones now and hope they will always make them for whatever phone I get in the future|
positive,4,Protects well| but BB confirmed there is a problem with S7 as there is a fairly wide 'halo' around the outside of the phone that looks like air bubbles| Nothing that can be done until Zagg has a fix|
positive,5,Love the Samsung Galaxy S7! Easy to use| and have had no issues with transferring information from my HCT One M8| Quality of photos ranks very high as does the brilliance of the colors in the Apps|
positive,5,Upgraded our samsung S5s| Lots of improvements| Our sales associate was very knowledgeable and helped us understand the new devices and which accessories would work best for us| Installed screen for us|
negtive,2,In the past| I really liked this product| However| I noticed the shield started to crack on the side within the first month of purchasing|
negtive,3,The day i got this cover I also got a new phone| A worker at bestbuy put it on my phone for me| The corners had a little air under it but was told its normal and it will even out| A week later it cracked|
positive,5,Extremely easy to install and works great| I have had it replaced once at no cost because it had developed a small crack| The clarity is great| I would buy it again!
positive,4,Upgraded from the regular Zigg to glass this time around| We all love but daughter's was applied by another store and she was not happy! Make sure you are satisfied before leaving the store|
positive,5,I always get Zagg shields| but this time I got the thicker glass screen for my new S7| I've dropped it a couple times| and it has a few cracks| but the phone's screen is still pristine|
positive,5,It cracked in two weeks of purchasing and I don't remember dropping it| Best buy replaced it free of charge and I've registered this second one and I feel safe having it| Say no to cracked screens!
negtive,2,I have bought 2 of these and they cracked within a day or two each time| It says that it has a lifetime warranty| and I registered| When I tried to do a vlaim| it says I am not recognized|
negtive,3,Does not hug the slight curves at the edges of an s7| Would be better if it was sized smaller| Since purchasing there are already cracks along the perimeter| It does offer scratch protection|
negtive,1,Doesn't fit the phone even though it's for an S7| Zagg is supposedly making a Glass Contour but it isn't out yet| Don't know why this one was ever made|
negtive,1,On the edges of the glass they do not stick due to the phones screen being somewhat curved| So after a couple days it gets dust and its not very attractive and rather annoying| Just a heads up
positive,5,I have purchased ZAGG previously and this one offers great protection for my S7 screen| The instructions make it easy to apply the protector to your phone and you can barely notice it|
negtive,1,1st one chipped in less than 24 hours| Cost $5|99 for s+h to replace| Does not fit flush on my phone screen| Best Buy can't help me| even though I bought an $800 phone and all accessories there|
positive,4,I like the idea of protecting my screen (which the product has done numerous times) but I certainly hate paying $6+ for shipping when I need a replacement protector| But the product alone is awesome
positive,5,I had the Best Buy Geek put it on and havent had any problems at all!!! This is a great product for my wife's Galaxy S 7||||| I will be getting the same product when I get the Galaxy S 8+|
positive,5,I got this screen protector to protect my new Samsung Galaxy S7 from scratched on the screen| It is always wise to get the right accessories to protect your phone from damage and scratches on the screen|
positive,5,It does a very good job -- I like the product| It helps keep the screen from breaking which my daughter has done many time on her phone| So I would recommend this product to anyone with a cell phone|
negtive,1,Broke within 7 days| Disappointed in quality and fit for a Galaxy 7| Has 3 year warranty| but have not had time to hassle with replacement steps|
negtive,1,The shield chipped within 24 hours and then the replacement has now chipped| Zagg products are terrible but they unfortunately seem to be the only option…there is a reason they offer free replacements|
positive,4,I love the protection of the screen| The only downside is that the thickness of the screen protector does not cover all of the screen and sometimes I have to hit a button a couple times to go through|
positive,5,We have used this excellent product before on our 2 old cell phones| We really like this screen cover & glad it was recommended to us 2 yrs ago by your Best Buy rep at our nearby store|
positive,5,I balked at the price of my invisishield however| it did a great job at saving my screen from cracking! I would rather pay the s/h fee for a new screen saver than buy a whole new screen for my phone!!
negtive,3,I have bought these particular invisible shields for every phone I had| This one isn't really good because the edge of the protector won't seal| It leaves a shadow when you are looking at your phone|
negtive,3,The first time I accidently set my phone face down on a hard surface the glass protector cracked| Maybe it hit something just right? I am about to use their lifetime warranty| hopefully that goes well|
positive,5,Product is durable and keeps my phone secure from any damage| Have used Zagg protective covers for years and always find the product reliable|
positive,4,I’ve enjoyed the screen protector on all my IPhones| Just wipe and screen is clear and the protection it offers is well worth the money| Love the replacement element| also
positive,5,I purchased this screen protector for my s7 since I don't change phones very often and my previous one was on a galaxy note II||||5 years old and|the screen never got a scratch on it||price is great
positive,5,This is easy to apply and privides excellent protection for my phone| I also love that this product is warrantied and the company will replace it for the cost of postage if it gets damaged|
negtive,1,Broke within a few months and then I realized that I had to pay shipping to get it replaced despite the inital higher price and included lifetime warranty|
negtive,3,i've used this brand before and have been impressed| but this one doesn't adhere around the whole edge| and has already started chipping from less than 3 drops| otherwise it's been good
positive,4,At first I got a faulty glass screen but once I spoke to Zang customer service THEY TOOK CARE OF IT! :) They over night a new screen and best buys Geek Squad put it together| BEST PORTECTOR EVER!!!
positive,5,We are so glad that we bought this product to protect our phone| It is so easy to wipe off and come clean|Protects the face of your phone|Can't go wrong on spending the money on this product|
negtive,1,Even though this is the screen made to fit the Samsung S7| it does NOT fit correctly| It will not seal correctly| It just comes up around the edges| Best Buy Geek Squad applied 3 of them|
positive,4,This is a bit hard to apply correctly| but does a great job protecting the phone| Lifetime replacement is wonderful| We have already gotten one replaced since our ballistic case did not do its job|
negtive,3,Well| this is my third Zagg shield| Each time I have to pay 8$ to have it replaced| Not made for Samsung 7 fit over the edges| The screen slants and the shield doesn't fit||
negtive,3,Everything is great except for the fit on the edges for the screen| it does not quite conform the slite curve of the screen| it allows a small space for dirt and dust to collect|
negtive,1,Boy do I wish I would of read the reviews before I bought this screen saver||||I edges don't fit the screen and I can see it being pulled off the screen and breaking||| not impressed at all||||
negtive,3,Looked OK for a bit but has chips on the edges in a few places- this with a case and being put in a pocket in my purse| BB applied it so not an error on my part for putting it on wrong|
positive,5,I found everything that i wss looking for| The people were very help and pleasent to talked to| The prices were right in line with other stores| The store was very clean| I will be back|
negtive,1,Should have read reviews| Does not sit flush on face due to bezel of phone case| leads to the shield cracking at the inside corners around the camera lense as well as the home button|
positive,5,The Zagg screen protector is simply and added bonus and a smart necessity to owning a new and fairly high-dollar S7 cell phone| It make s me feel much better to have than not have it!!
positive,5,Got a really good price at BB and the associate did a nice job installing it| Zagg took a beating on a different phone but kept the phone like new| The free replacement program worked well|
positive,5,This is the second screen protector from this company that i used and I swear a day after I bought my phone I hit it against something and the screen protector did its job!!!! I love this product!!!!
positive,4,This is a must have for me| Wish it covered the whole glass of the screen| Weird air pockets showup after Best Buy Mobile rep installs them| This time it took 60-90 days to show the bubbles|
positive,5,Have these on all my mobile phones| They work great| Have saved my screen from breaks many times| Have had the glass protectors replaced via warranty thru Zagg with zero issues| many times|
positive,5,I have purchased this for multiple devices and those that have broken have been replaced with ease| keeping the screen of the phone protected and safe from wear| Definitely worth the money!
positive,4,Very easy to install; Simply press on; Invisible and provides scratch protection to the screen| Have not had a drop yet so unsure how protective it would be| Good value @ $18|99
negtive,2,Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7| I have bought one of these for every smart phone that Ive had and never had a problem until now| this doesn't fit like it should|
negtive,1,Did not like the fact that it required more pressure on the touch screen to activate what's the screen protector was applied| I took it off shortly after and replaced it with a less rigid one|
positive,4,Don't buy this one| and it's not Best buy it's Zagg| They make a curved screen protector that will not bubble| Buy that instead| They manager at the store out this on excellent though!
negtive,3,After being told by a BB employee this is the best out there it cracked in the first week on the edges| While it has a replacement option I haven't had the time to deal with that yet|
positive,5,I try to be really carefully with any of my electronics| but let's be honest|||accidents happen| I have dropped my phone and couple of times and this has protected my phone amazingly well|
positive,5,Zagg is a very good glass screen protector| Looks just like the screen with no protection| Screen crisp and clear and easy to clean| To my surprise| doesn't leave many fingerprints at all|
positive,5,I love Zagg | they stick by their products and honor their agreements| I love the fact that it has a lifetime warranty| from this day forward I will only buy Zagg screen covers to protect my phone|
positive,5,Although I think Best Buy could come up with a better way for installation (i|e|| mobile should apply rather than Geek Squad)| this product is one of the best screen protectors available|
positive,5,This is my second purchase| i had the first sheild for 1 year| i treat my phone rough| the sheild cracked but my phone was intact| Had to to get the same protection|
negtive,3,Zagg protectors are usually good but this one is not| It ruins the touch of the phone so you have to bang on the keys and even then you may have to hit the keys around the edge more than once|
positive,5,This is a great protective device for my phone| This will help to ensure that I will a good clear screen that will be protected from scratching and can be easily cleaned|
negtive,3,I really like zagg but they dropped the ball on this one| The screw protector doesn't cover the how screen| For some reason on the edges it doesn't completely stick| Kind of a waster of 40 dollara
negtive,2,I've had many phones and always use a screen protector| This is the first time it's ever broken| Within the first month of getting it| So ||| I'm a bit disappointed to be honest| Good luck|
positive,4,I bought this to protect my s7| While I think it did it's job protecting my screen it seemed to happen quickly| I'm not sure it it's ultra sensitive or I had something pushing against my screen|
negtive,3,The glass screen protector already cracked and chips on the edges| It did it with my last phone also| It is however better than the old school one's that you needed to replace every month|
negtive,3,The glass doesnt curve to the edges so you get cracks pretty easy| The only saving grace is the "free" replacements| The only thing is you still have to pay or shipping|
positive,5,Purchased a cheaper screen protector initially and was a waste of money| This one has no bubbles| is easy to clean and has a lifetime warranty| Will not hesitate to purchase for future phones|
positive,5,AT first I was uneasy getting screen protector but once Best Buy put it on I was supper content| So far I love this item| no issues what so ever| I highly recommend this product|
positive,4,The screen protector does it's job but I'm not highly satisfied with it| It doesn't seem like it fits the phone completely| It didn't mold to the screen fully|
positive,5,This is a great product| I had one of these on my Galaxy S5 and it saved my phone| Dropped it from 5 feet and only the glass protector broke! Saved me $400 and the phone!
positive,4,This glass screen protector saved my screen on numerous occasions|One bad thing though| it didn't fit very well| It didn't fit my dad's either|
positive,5,Would you like to have a cell phone with a damaged screen that's permanent or know that a fix is available to prevent this in the first place? It;s a no brainer as to what you should do|
negtive,3,The screen on the Galaxy 7 is pretty touch but the added protection is worth the small price| The screen is easy to clean| does not interfere with the touch screen capabilities of the phone|
positive,4,Easy to apply| Edges don't stay down when cover is put on but once the cover is on you don't notice it once it's on| Works perfect| dropped phone many times with no issues|
negtive,2,Chipped the first day I got it| then cracked and now has a huge crack all across the screen protector| Went to look for a replacement on the site and the product page says nothat available|
positive,5,These are the best screen protectors in my opinion and the only ones I use| the edges can get lifted sometimes if used with certain cases| I never get a new phone without getting a Zagg|
negtive,1,I have always used Zagg products| but this one is just all wrong| Leaves a "halo" around the edge of the screen since the screen is slightly curved and the glass is not|
positive,5,This is a great screen protector & has saved the screen on my phone many times| Best Buy does great job putting it on too!
positive,5,Definitely worth the money for this glass screen protector! Easy to keep clean and feels great when using your phone unlike the plastic screen protectors|
positive,5,My wife and I have these on our phones| You cannot beat the warranty from ZAGG| We've used their products on our S5s and S7s and have never broken our screens|
positive,5,Purchasing another Zagg was a must| We've used these products for years now and any time there's a need for an exchange it's quick and simple| Would never use another screen protector!
positive,4,I have been overall pleased with this screen protector with one exception| You have to press a little harder than you normally would with a pliable protector| Other than that|||it's all good!!!
positive,5,Every cell| computer| tablet that requires some type of computer screen protector I highly recommend Zagg| It gets cracked| broken| I pay a small fee and get it replaced!!! SO worth it!!!
positive,5,I really like this cover| It is very clear and smooth to the touch| My only complaint is that you have to push a little harder on your screen| I guess due to the thickness of the glass|
negtive,3,It cracked in two places first week i had it but i would rather it crack than my screen to crack| Even though it wasnt 30 days best buy made me go through the manufacturer to get a replacement|
positive,4,Just be aware that this Zagg product does not completely seal on the edges of the S7 due to the curvature of the phone| Does allow some dust to find it's way under the glass|
positive,4,Screen shields help keep expensive phone screens from getting scratched and/or broken| and in my case| keep sweat from staining the original screen| lol
positive,5,Although a little pricey it is well worth it| I cracked my last screen protector and gother a new one for the price of shipping| Bought another one for my new phone| Well worth the money|
negtive,3,This screen protector seems to be working ok| my main issue with it seems to easily separate from the phone around the edges| Not sure the adhesive is the issue or something else|
negtive,2,I would not recomended| It leaves a halo affect on the edges of phone| I was told this is normal| Concerned with dirt specs getting in between film and phone where the halo is|
negtive,1,Was recommended this product from associates| Terrible product would never buy again| Not worth the money| Scratches easily| I have used much cheaper products that have worked much better|
positive,5,My wife hates the bulky protectors and just cannot use them in small purses| This screen protection is exactly what she needed
positive,5,With the ZAGG glass| I've always used the Zagg film protector before and loved it| I was skeptical about the glass but it works great with no effect on the screen image and resolution|
negtive,3,The screen protector does not lay flat on the screen as the screen is curved| Ended up contacting Zagg and getting their curved version| Zagg was very helpful and great services!!
positive,4,It definitely protects your screen| Make sure you put it on a time with no interruptions| The company does honor their product by sending a new one and then you must return the old one
positive,5,This glass cover has not impacted performance| Only wish it was curved at the edges to match the actual glass| The new version comes curved|
positive,4,Although the glass screen protector goes on great with no bubbles| it seems to be very delicate| Ionly had mine 12 days before a corner cracked somehow| Big perk is the lifetime warranty|
negtive,3,So far I haven't been to impressed with this screen protector| It bubbles on the side so it doesn't look very neat| It has chipped already just from sitting down hard on hard surface|
positive,5,This Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector is super clear and fits perfectly| In my case it is the extra protection I need| and easily wipes clean with the provided cloth|
positive,4,I'm not sure if the screen protector breaks easier then the phone screen| But I'll take replacing the life time free replacement protector over paying 150$ to replace the actual screen|
negtive,3,I found it difficult to install correctly on my phone and I still have some bubbles & places where it doesn't adhere completely| Not much better than a standard screen protector| IMO|
positive,5,Easy installation took minutes to complete| great protection civers entire screen with holes for camera| no problems reading my touch| no issues at all |I am very pleased with this product|
negtive,3,Good quality but unfortunately once you apply it on the phone both sides will stick out a little| I wish they designe it little curve on both sides so it would fit perfectly|
positive,5,Easy to attach| The design of the phone makes it difficult to use on edges| so I placed this to the inside edge as far as I could|
positive,5,Very impressed with the quality of this glass screen protector! I love that it has a lifetime warranty! If the phone drops the protector is supposed to crack instead of your screen|
positive,4,I upgraded from Samsung Galaxy 5| I find the battery power much better with this phone| unless I'm using media such as YouTube or listening to music| I find the picture quality the same|
positive,4,I love that the screen protector is not attached to the case| You don't even notice it's on there| Just be careful because if you do drop your phone you can crack the screen protector|
negtive,1,I'm disappointed that they would make it without even a slight curve to match the S7 (not S7 Edge)| So when I put it on the edges didn't stay with the curvature of the screen|
negtive,2,The screen protector is ok| Easy to install yourself| Its stick down almost automatically| However the edges down not stick like the rest of the screen| Being glass it does not bend|
negtive,1,this product has already broke in the first week of having it| I have not got it fixed yet because of time and will I have to pay an amount to fix it| It is a crack on the screen|
positive,5,It's glass that sits on your glass screen| I had one in the past and when I dropped my phone it broke and not the screen| Much cheaper investment and if you register it| it's warrantied|
positive,5,I have used this for a few months now| It was put on my phone and then covered with an OtterBox Defender case| Dropped once| zero damage| Screen still looks as new as the first day|
positive,5,We had a family member have a screen break and we had this installed to protect the new screen and it is clearer than the plastic one we had installed when we bought the phone
negtive,3,Not pleased with the way it fits went through a couple of them before I got one that fit without any air bubbles| It recently chipped so I won't be buying this type of screen protector again|
positive,5,We were told by the store clerk that this protector was the best one on the market| After talking to the product service we knew that this was the best advice to help protect our phones|
negtive,2,I'm very rough with my phone's so I bought this because I thought it would work| Needless to say within a week it was already cracked| Good thing they offer a warranty with it|
positive,5,This Android Phone Glass Screen Protector is a very heavy duty material to prevent any damages & scratches| HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
positive,5,Love this screen protector! It's smooth like the screen would be with out a protector| Also has a lifetime warranty| if it cracks all you have to do is pay for shipping!
negtive,1,This is the second one of these that I've bought| Each one has cracked within the first 24 hours of having it| The edges do not seal properly to the phone| which causes the issue|
negtive,3,This is my second one both had the same problem| Within just a few days i had chips on the outside edges| Everything else works fine| but for the price| this should not be an issue
positive,5,Zagg makes great screen protectors for the Samsung phone its scratch resistant| strong| and easy to clean| I would buy this brand again|
positive,5,The lifetime warranty is amazing| Yes I've dropped my phone a few times and had to replace the screen saver| For close to $5 they send me a new one everytime|
positive,4,No scratches or dings on my phone| but the protected has lips on either side that won't stick down all the way| so it gets dirty in between protector and phone| Otherwise| it's pretty good|
positive,5,With an active lifestyle| my phone sees extraordinary wear and tear| This glass shield maintains a great display and keeps my phone looking and operating like new|
positive,4,It is very protective for your screen| Best there is| However| the s7 has a small dip around outside of screen that the shield cannot cover due to its rigidness| It creates a halo effect|
positive,5,Love it| it makes me feel very safe with it on| Do not worry about cracking my screen| I had the store salesperson put it on for me to be sure of a perfect fit|
positive,5,we had tried other brands and they came off after 2 days| We purchased this ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 and its been working great
negtive,1,This protector is too large for the S7| It is not an edge but still has curved sides| The protector does not mine cracked the first day I had it because the edges didn't curve down|
negtive,3,a complete protection for your touchscreen| The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because of the price and for some reason the edges do not seem to be completely sticking to the phone|
positive,5,I have already dropped my phone a couple of times and this has saved my screen from shattering| This paired with the Otterbox case is almost a 100% full proof from ever damaging your phone|
positive,5,I am uncertain how this screen cover compares to a plastic one| as I am easy on my phones| However| I can tell you that it doesn't affect the sensitivity of the screen and it is very clear|
positive,5,Love the tempered glass screen protectors| they have saved me so much money and insurance claims over the past few years| I would never buy a phone that zagg does not make a protector for|
positive,4,Really wished it fit over the whole screen I was told zagg was the best but I have nor found one that covers the whole screen otherwise is the best I have had but is a little pricey
positive,5,I like the slim design yet solid construction of this smartphone protector| The smooth finish allows me to slide it in and out of my pocket with ease yet it's not too slippery|
negtive,1,Doesn't fit the phone properly| Don't waste your money unless you want to have a screen protector that doesn't go all the way to edges causing issues with touching the edges|
positive,5,I've had the Galaxy S7 for less than one month| and already have "marks" on the screen protector| I've already ordered and received a Zagg screen protector replacement| Glad I had it|
positive,5,Well worth the price| I would never think of NOT getting this for my phone| Very easy to apply (and remove and reapply| when you haven't aimed correctly)| Also easy to keep clean|
negtive,1,A few days after I bought the protector| it began to crack| It now has several places where it is cracked| Soon| when I replace my cell phone| I will buy another type of protector
positive,5,Love the fact that Zagg has a life time warranty as long as you remember to register the product| Great glass covering that doesn't affect the touch screen making it slow or draggy!
positive,5,I love this shield! I've literally dropped my phone so many times and the screen doesn't crack! After several falls the only thing that cracks is the shield! But really protects my screen!
negtive,1,This protector does not seamlessly fit| It was on for less than 2 days before it snagged in my pocked| The slight curve on the display| makes it separate around all 4 edges of the phone|
negtive,1,Does not fit the slit curved screen of the S7| My wife had it installed on her S7 and the edges did not adhere| They have since cracked and we will be submitting request for refund|
negtive,2,I only had it for about a week before it broke| Don't remeber the glass being this fragile when I had it for my iPhone| Save the money until it gets more durable
positive,4,Since this Screen Protector For Samsung Galaxy S7 is glass it is very clesar and scratch resistant| When I cracked the edge of the protector the warranty replacement was very smooth|
negtive,3,The screen is doesn't fit the S7 when i drop my phone first time is crack on my glass screen but think again i rather to be crack on my protection instead of my real phone
positive,5,I love this shield and it is the best shield I have purchased! I have had 5 smart phones over the years using plastic shields| Never again| I will recommend this shield to everyone!!!!!
negtive,2,Protector srlticks up from the edges making it susceptible to peeling up on breaking easily om the edge| I had to go back to the store and have it replaced with a plastic one
positive,5,Works great as protecting your screen from drops or falls| I actually dropped it and crackedcracked the protecter| Screen had no damaged| it definitely worked as I was told in the store|
positive,5,I love zagg glass screen protectors| It was installed at Best Buy at the time of purchase| I will definitely continue to buy zagg glass screen protectors again for my other products|
positive,4,Good idea to protect the screen on the cell phone| We've used this product before and it has prevented damage to the phone| Highly recommend using a product like this|
positive,4,This screen protector gets closer to the edge than any others but does still habe a halo| This is the best one I have found unyil they come up with a better one
negtive,2,Bought one unit and after 2 weeks it cracked on the edge| got a new to apply for the warranty and before I got to it| it cracked also| My last one held for over a year|
negtive,3,I've used this product before on my Galaxy S6 but noticed this shield does not fit completely across and around my screen on my S7 - still does the job so far but it is quite pricey|
positive,5,The sales guy assisted me in finding what I was looking for and even applied it on my phone for me| It was just what I needed and looks clear and nice on the phone|
positive,5,Got this as a replacement for another protector that scratched and cracked| My phone has been handled the same and dropped| But no scratches or cracks| Very happy with Zagg|
positive,5,It's was recommended by the associate who assisted me because the one I requested for was not as good as this one| He also explained to me the advantage and disadvantages|
positive,4,After dropping my cell hard the Zagg Glass had a large crack that did not go through to my screen| I also was covered by their warranty for a new Zagg Glass|
positive,5,we had them on our last Samsung 5 phones and a tractor tailor ran over one of our phones and the only this cracked was the screen protector| we did have on otter case on it too|
negtive,3,The protector does its job but it does not stick completely on the screen| The edges on both sides are up| BB employees tried 4 different ones and they all ended up doing the same thing|
positive,4,Was wanting to up-grade phone but didn't want to upgrade to the S8| I wasn't wanting to replace all my chargers| so thats why I went with the S7| So far so good|
negtive,1,Thought it would provide good protection |||didnt drop just simply had my phone in my bag as i always have and its alresdy cracked| Only good thing is it has a lifetime warranty
positive,4,I love my Zagg glass shield| My fingers glide across so effortlessly on the screen| I just love the feel of it unlike the cheap plastic one sold|
positive,5,I decided on this item after i had tried another one| What a difference| Extremely clear and easy to install (a bubble at first put easy to push out)|
negtive,3,Samsung needs to do a better job at providing product to protect the equipment better| The glass protector did not fit screen properly but will give better protection than nothing|
positive,4,Works good but sometimes it affects when I use the touch of my fingers on the screen would like that to be a little bit better other than that it seems to work pretty good
positive,4,Dropped my phone day after putting screen on and my screen was safe| Screen protector not so much| Had to get a replacement but so glad I had the screen protector on| Worth the price|
negtive,1,This product doesnt fit the Samsung Galaxy S7 at all| The curved edges of the phone ( on the regular| not Edge version) prevent the screen protector from being applied properly|
positive,4,We have used these screen protectors several times over the years| and it has protected the cell phone screen from breaking and from requiring a more costly repair|
positive,4,keeps your screen from cracking| Zagg will warranty their glass if you register them on their website| If the glass breaks they will send you a new one for free just pay $5|99 S/H
positive,5,I already had the phone but needed a new glass protector screen|Had Geek Squad @ Best Buy install it| Very happy with service!
positive,5,Zagg products are excellent product and come with a hassle free lifetime warranty| The pricing for this product at Best Buy was $5|00 less than purchasing directly from manufacturer!
negtive,2,I cannot remember the last time I did not have a Zagg on a mobile| However| this one I could have done without| It never adhered properly and it was put on by Best Buy personnel|
negtive,3,It protected my screen| kept it shiny| applied easily| Unfortunately| it made it nearly impossible to type anything| I ended up removing it| It broke in the process|
positive,5,I like that this protects my phone screen if I drop my phone| The only thing that I dislike is the glass is hard to clean|although I bought a micro-cloth to clean it and it works great
positive,4,Functional screen protection that fits well with cases| Seems overpriced compared to other similar products| but overall a small investment to help protect an expensive phone|
positive,5,I always use zagg comes with a lifetime warranty pretty expensive but I do crack the screen protector every now and then| I just send it back and pay shipping and handling|
positive,5,This is the second phone I have put this one and I love| Works very well| Drop on street and broke the Zagg glass but not the screen| Replacement was so simple|
positive,5,This is the 3rd time we've bought a phone and bought the invisible shield to protect the phones| Has always done a great job! Goes on real smooth and you don't even know it's on|
positive,5,This works great protects your screen from cracking| The screen protector last a long time before needed replaced|
positive,4,I've always had good luck with Zagg| Another great screen protector for my Galaxy S7| Just wish it fit the slight curve on the edges of the screen better so it was more sealed|
negtive,1,I paid BB to install it for me and it was done incorrectly| Now need a new one| I will stop by and ask for it|
positive,4,Glass shield works| but the halo effect is very distracting| I with they showed me an example prior to me buying it| I would have opted for the thin sticker type shield|
positive,5,The ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass screen protector really works| It was easy to install and it is very easy to clean| so I don't have to worry about finger prints or smudges on my phone|
positive,4,I just noticed a scratch in the glass and a small chip so I will see how the lifetime warranty works and update the review after that|
positive,5,This screen protector is awesome and very easy to apply to the phone| It does a great job| and not bulky and doesn't interfere with the case I have on it! Would highly recommend!
positive,4,Good screen protector| especially if you tend to drop your phone a lot| Make sure it's installed correctly because if the edges aren't placed appropriately| they begin to crack|
positive,4,I have a habit of dropping my phone| Each time my screen has cracked| I have dropped my phone several times since i put this on and it hasn't broken yet!
positive,4,Zagg screen protectors seem to be the best fitting for my last 3 phones| They are easy to install as well| The only downfall is price| They are expensive compared to most|
positive,5,Great product| Best buy tends to keeo there prices up on nane brand stuff| They dont lower there prices often to meet other competitors prices for how old the product is|
negtive,2,Putting on was the first horror of this product| I had to write the company because it also did not fit right|| was easily dented with nails too
positive,5,If you are someone who drops your phone a bunch| this is something you must have| The money spent on this has already saved me coupless hundred bucks on a replacement screen
negtive,2,The screen protector was fine and easy to put on but since the edges of my S7 phone are round| the screen protector did not lay flat on the the screen of the phone|
negtive,1,Very disappointed about this screen protector| Because of the screen curved of the phone| lateral edges of the screen protector remain raised and will be very soon full of dirt|
positive,5,This is the only brand I use for screen covers| They come with a warranty if you register them| They work great| You don't even realize it's on your phone|
negtive,1,Had this for 6 days on my phone before it cracked| Warranty is a joke| $19 to ship it and you have to pay to return the old one| Never buy from this company again|
negtive,1,This protector affected the ability to type/press things correctly on the phone as it did not lay properly on the screen with curved edges
positive,4,I love the glass Protector for my cell phone| Just don't like the fact that I was charged for the salesperson to put it on my phone|
positive,5,I have purchased multiple Zagg products| This one most recently for my daighter's Galaxy S7| It provides fantastic protection and a smooth feel when using the phone|
positive,5,My first one worked so well I got another one when I upgraded my phone| It does a great job of keeping the screen intact if it does get a crack| Definitely my go-to brand
positive,5,I love this Zagg screen protector| It keeps my screen free from scratches and it wipes clean with a tissue or cloth| It was easy to put on and so far it has stayed on| I love it!
positive,5,I have Zagg screen protectors for all of my family as well as myself| They honor their guarantee and even when I cracked the zagg protector| my phone screen was not damaged!
positive,5,This can be a bit tricky to put on the phone| I used GEEK SQUAD to help| Once it's on it will certainly protect your phone from the everyday abuse we put our phones through
positive,5,This is my 3rd protector and it works great| My old phone was hit it the corner of the screen| The protector saved my screen| It did break the protector but it was replaceable|
positive,5,Could not have found what I needed for my daughter phone the same day purchasing it| Two in one a shield which protects her phone from getting a cracked screen and also a case|
positive,4,I have dropped my phone tons and this has kept my phone from cracking| I am just now getting some fracture lines in it after tons of drops!! Still working well|
positive,5,I love the feel of this screen saver as i use it| I have had many different screen protectors on many different phone and this is the best| It doesn't show fingerprints either|
negtive,2,Needs improvement for the Samsung Galaxy 7| Edges don't lay down flat ands one corner is already torn| barely a month old| Poor quality that definitely needs to be redesigned|
positive,5,I have never used the glass before| This makes the screen really bright and it's really smooth when using the touch screen| Best buy installed it and did a great job|
positive,5,I love these glass protectors| I have dropped my phone twice and cracked the protector| But my phone is fine| Best buy does a good job putting them on|
negtive,2,It did not stay flush with the edge of my phone screen| so I ended up returning it| however it otherwise did its job| protecting my phone for the few short days I had it|
positive,5,In my experience| Zagg makes the best| top quality screen protectors that can last the life of your phone| They also have a lifetime replacement guarantee| Buy with confidence|
positive,5,After having to switch phones since the first "new one " died| I decided to get the protective case| It doesn't cover the whole screen| but seems to be doing its job
negtive,1,The outer edges don't stick to the phone and therefore makes it look ugly| Not sure if I got a defective piece| Would not buy again|
positive,5,Wasn't sure if I was going to like the glass because always had zagg gel protectors but love it! Keeps the screen crystal clear while offering awesome protection from damage|
positive,5,We have many Zagg products and they are all wonderful! I would recommend protecting your items with them above all others any day of the week!
positive,5,I love Zagg products| Every device that i own i make sure i get one of these| Protects the screen and has a lifetime warranty|
positive,5,The glass screen protector is very good and I like how it protected the phone for breaking my phone fall from my lap and crack protecting my phone screen from breaking
positive,5,I have been buying zagg screen protectors since ived owned a smart phone| They are best in class with lifetime warranties and offer superb protection against lifes dangers|
positive,5,This screen protector is amazing and with the lifetime warranty provided by ZAGG| well worth it| I'm rough on my phone and they replace it everything no questions asked|
negtive,2,The edges of the glass screen protector do not fully adhere to the screen and it bothered me| a LOT| if you want it to adhere all the way around on the s7| do not get this one|
negtive,1,Very disappointed that I spent money on this screen protector Right and left edges are not sticking to the screen| I am getting dirt and dust under the protector
negtive,2,This was recommended to me however it got a few nicks around the edges within a week and then cracked completely| This was without the phone being dropped|
negtive,1,The cover did NOT fit the phone| Although it said it was for a Samsung 7s the edges did not stay down| I had to take it off and replace it with another cover|
positive,4,Clean and clear| My last screen protector was plastic|| this is TERRIFIC| Not a big gap on the sides| so no "ick" along the edges of the phone| Fights off fingerprints too!!
positive,4,Very clear| don't even notice it is on phone| Like replacement warranty| no fussing around with fixing the screen if broken| Only drawback is it is mildly difficult to install|
positive,4,Although it is a great product the shape of the Galaxy S7 has a bent shape which has the ends of each side of the zag screen unaffixed rovthw screen
positive,5,I have used this before and I really like the look and feel| I have aslo dropped my phone and the screen protector my crack but the real phone screen stays undamaged|
negtive,2,Im not a partier| a drinker| nor do I have an attitude problem||||but somehow this screen protector cracked within the first couple weeks of me owning it| No idea how|
positive,4,I was looking for a good screen protector and I feel that this is the perfect one! It has a warranty with it which is a plus|
positive,5,Great screen protector| I dropped my phone face down on the asphalt and screen protector cracked but phone screen was without a scratch| Definitely must have|
positive,5,Provides full coverage for my screen| Nice clear view for viewing photos unobstructed| Unlike other screen protectors I tried| this one covers the entire screen|
positive,5,My husband is a rather simple guy who doesnt like flashy things but wants the protection of not a case that ensure no cracks to your phone| This case does just as described|
negtive,1,This is a glass type cover and for the Galaxy 7 the glass cover does not hold to the edges and by day 2 the edges around both phones had all lifted up cut my wife's fingers
positive,5,Love zagg products| Accidentally dropped the phone and the only thing that happened was the glass shield cracked| Thanks to a lifetime warranty ill have a replacement soon|
negtive,1,Listen to the other reviews! Does not fit the last 1/8 inch around the phones edges of the regular s7| It decreases touch sensitivity and looks horrible| Bad product|
positive,5,It fit well and was easy to apply myself| Best Buy will put it on for $8| which I did not do| I felt that was too high a price|
negtive,2,Replaced and cracked again within a month without ever dropping my phone once| Warranty is a joke| You have to pay shipping and handling of about $6 every time
negtive,3,Because the S7 (I do not have the Edge) has a slight curve to it the screen saver doesn't seal on the edges| Buy the lifetime warranty and have it replaced when you need it|
positive,4,This product works great| but you know it's time for a new phone when this was the only option for a screen protector! Would buy this brand for new phone as well
positive,5,Hands down the best product for a cell phone| Easy to install| easy to remove if you have to replace it| easy to clean| Looks just like glass| like it belongs on your phone|
positive,5,This screen protector is very easy to apply and is thicker than most| It is very responsive to touch and controls the phone fine while protecting the screen
negtive,3,Got this screen protector and the sides of the film does not sit on the phone really well| Does not cover the whole phone| Dirt gets under it and it is annoying|
negtive,1,1 star because it doesn't fit the rounded edges of the 7|i wish they had something that works| I received a different cover from zag| And still have issues with the edges|
negtive,3,This is the second Zagg cover my wife has had and already chipped| It has protected the screen but still has little cracks in it| She is not one to drop her phone|
negtive,2,I can't seem to have any luck with Zigg protective covers| This is my 3rd protective cover (two regular skins and 1 glass ( and they just quite fit for Galaxy 7| Cm on Zigg!
positive,5,Wouldn't own a smart phone without this tempered glass screen protector! This stuff has SAVED several phone screens in my family| Can't beat the lifetime guarantee!!!
positive,5,Zagg screen protectors have always proven to be excellent investment protection for many typs of devices| I cannot imagine having a phone or tablet without one|
positive,4,Solid choice of screen protector| easy to install and came out with no bubbles| just be careful of dust and lint| easy for it to sneak in on you last minute|
negtive,3,Bought the glass screen protector from a recommendation by a friend| It was put on properly by the BB employee but cracked within days| without me dropping it|
positive,4,The protector doesn't interfere with the screen| which is nice| but the edges refuse to stick to my screen and leave a weird rim|
positive,5,I love the zagg cover for my phone I drop it all the time and it never breaks| And it's great that you can just send it in and get a new one whenever it does break|
positive,5,Another smart buy to protect the face from scratching| If you are getting a new phone at Best Buy| take a second and pick up some Invisible Shield you wont regret it|
positive,4,great protector| no bubbles like with plastic ones| I would like to see it extend further to edge of phone|||leaves a edge line that doesn't quite meet with phone cover|
positive,5,It's no easier to put on than any other screen saver (why aren't these standard!) but it does the job| cleans easily
positive,5,Well made| compact| robust| easily installed| As weight is less a factor for me than bulk a padded cover without the convenience of added battery power made little sense|
positive,5,Screen protector is a must have| Protects from scratching from any object| I didn't trust myself for putting it on correctly| so the sales associate did it for me|
positive,5,This product is an absolute must have for cell phones and/or tablets (different size of course)| It definitely works and does the job! Warranty makes it even better|
positive,5,This is my 2nd one| the 1st worked great and even saved my phone's screen from damage after dropping| The edges don't fit perfect but does the job|
positive,5,I have never bought a different screen protector for any of my phones| But I don't know why I would| The Zagg is everything I need| Never breaks down| And I love the feel|
negtive,2,The Film is to strong and it would not stick to a screen on the edges|So looks kind of ugly and dust collects underneath|The Soft film is a much better choice|
negtive,1,Zagg invisibleshield protects the screen but on the outside edges it's not completely in contact with the screen| Allowing dust to be collected under shield|
positive,5,I'm really rough on my phone| This is cheap insurance for my screen| I go through 3 or 4 per year using lifetime warranty| Wouldn't dream if not using one|
positive,5,This screen protector has saved my phone a few times from serious drops| It is very durable and with the warranty| one can not go wrong with this purchase|
negtive,2,The glass was a good idea and works good|BUT with the galaxy S7 glass being slightly curved it leaves a halo around the edge| It started peeling up after a couple of weeks|
positive,5,I have used this screen protector on other phones and in spite of a couple of drops| the only thing that cracked was the protectors| My phone screen remained intact|
negtive,3,The edges of the phone are a bit rounded so the screen has a gap around all edges| It is hard to type or swip on edges| It will not always recognize your selection|
negtive,1,I bought this screen protector and had Best buy put it on the phone| Dropped phone 3 days later and broke my phone screen| Did not break the screen protector|
positive,5,My son purchased this for his Galaxy S7| and he loves it! We both love the glass screen protectors| as they look nicer and are far more durable than the plastic ones!
positive,5,Fits the phone perfectly and so far have no problems with it lifting on the sides or corners| Does not interfere with the sensitivity of the touch functions on the phone|
negtive,3,The slight curve on the edges of the phone screen keeps the glass screen protector from adhering on the edges resulting in a gap that allows dust to collect under it|
positive,5,I drive for a living| In and out of a semi daily| Accidents happen and I’ve dropped my phone a couple times| Screen cover is worth it’s price
positive,4,I tend to drop my phone allot| It's a huge comfort knowing that the scratches and chips are the protector and not the screen of my phone| Totally worth the price
negtive,1,first day got a chip on the screen protector| It has since chip on corner and side| Don't know why I have a close cover for it| would not recommend|
positive,4,Learning how to use my phone and it's apps| I like it quite well| but I am use to a flip phone and have to wonder why somethings have to be made more difficult to use|
positive,4,Works well and is pretty easy to install| Cannot be removed without cracking| so be very careful when installing|
negtive,3,It started to come off of the corner of my phone after a couple of months| Also| this is a very thick protector|
positive,5,The man who showed me the Zagg put it on my phone for me and made sure that I understood the warranty on the screen protector| Good service and a great product|
negtive,1,I dropped my phone one time and the entire tempered glass broke I have had others that never broke so quickly|||it didn't stick on the corners of the phone either
negtive,1,This does not mate properly with the curved glass on the s7 display| Yoh WILL have a halo effect around the edges| Mine lasted about 2 weeks before it cracked| Stay away
positive,5,I love this product and have purchased| and replaced under warranty| on all the phones in our house (iPhone 4| 5| 5s| and now 7 as well as Samsung S4 and now S7)|
negtive,3,The shield is already cracked around the edges| There is a guarantee but my preference would have been longevity instead of having to return and replace|
negtive,3,Cost to much and easy chips / cracks| Mine chipped at the top the first day I got it and my fiancés cracked the 3rd day| Could have got a cheaper one and been better off|
positive,5,I have these on all my phones| It's a great product to protect the screen of your phone| When it needs replacing| it 's a quick and easy online process|
negtive,2,I've had it less than 2 months and its already broken twice| I guess it is protecting my screen| but the second time it cracked it was never dropped| It just happened|||
positive,5,I recommend these for all your devices! I love the fact that if it cracks or chips they will send you out a new one as long as you're registered! Great product!
positive,5,When you have a $800 phone a $30 screen cover should be a necessity| I can't tell you how this is probably save me $120 Insurance co-pay three or four times
positive,5,Bought this on sale| This project is easy to use| Can be a little difficult putting it on| You may also bring to phone store and they will apply it for free|
positive,5,These are the best for saving for saving your phone Had a another phone cracked shield 2 times Zagg replaced every time|
negtive,2,The cover for the Samsung 7 does not fit even close to the older ones| It gaps around the edges and is peelng up around the edges| Good thing is it is warrantied|
positive,5,Bought this to keep the screen in good shape| I work in harsh environments and this does the job so far| It was easy to install and looks good on the phone|
positive,5,This is working just fine| It installed easily (online videos helped on this--better then just the skimpy print instructions supplied)|
negtive,3,Apparently a bad batch of these came in so I have to go back at a later date once new stock comes in| Has a little something going down the left side of the glass saver|
positive,5,Great protection for my phone| If this glass breaks| just contact them and a free replacement is shipped to you|
negtive,2,Protects glass with lifetime warranty||| but small cracks within one day from regular use (no drops) for large cost in store| Must pay shipping to get a new one| Meh|
negtive,1,This screen protector did not fit my Galaxy S7 phone| You will want to ensure you are buying the newest glass screen protector that Zagg has developed for the S7 phones|
positive,5,Had installed in store for additional charge| Not thrilled for additional charge but thrilled that there aren't bubbles on product if installed by self|
positive,5,A gift for one of my daughters| She specifically asked for it because she has used this product for years| Wish it came in a softer form|
positive,4,As usual Zagg makes good screen protectors| The only issue I have is that it creates a halo effect around the edge of the phone because it doesn't fit it perfectly|
positive,5,this screen guard is fully covered my samsung galaxy s7| so full protection for my phone|| regular glass screen guards not full covering S7| so i liked this||
positive,4,I did have a problem with the first one I had went ahead and got another one and it's working out fine nice thing about it is also a lifetime warranty
negtive,2,I made the mistake of buying this as soon as the s7 came out| The protector does not fit properly and the edges are exposed so stuff gets stuck right under|
positive,5,My first Samsung Smartphone and I love it| I am still learning all the great features| A friend recommended this to me and I I have no regrets so far| A great product|
negtive,2,I purchased this mainly due to the fact I needed a screen protector| I've used these in the past| but this one didn't last two months before peeling in corners|
negtive,2,My previous phone was a Samsung|When I call from the same area| my reception is poor now and calls are dropped 90% of the time on this new phoneWhat's up?
positive,4,Virtually invisible this protector saves your screen from breakage and scratches| The replacement policy is great too although I wish I was using it less that I am|
positive,5,I purchased the geek squad installation so that if it ever breaks they will re-install it for me| I have this in combination with an Otterbox| and it works great|
positive,5,Dropped my phone and busted this screen all up but it saved the phone screen| Easy to order the replacement| Make sure you register your original screen right away|
positive,4,protect is lifted on the edges on the s7| It appears that it is not sealed around the outter edge| Still protects a majority of the screen or the "meat"of the phone
positive,4,Purchased the ZAGG glass to protect my girlfriends phone screen| Chipped slightly on one edge but has prevented scratches to the screen|
positive,5,This screen protector is great| I didn't think I needed one at all| but after having the phone fall I was happy I got it| I have no cracks or scratches at all!
positive,5,YOU WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON YOUR NEW PHONE SO I RECOMMEND THIS IS A MUST HAVE| PLEASE DON'T GO CHEAP ON A PROTECTION COVER| IT IS WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT|
negtive,1,As most others have noted| this item does not correctly fit the Samsung Galaxy S7| Their is a "halo" around the edges that is unacceptable|
positive,5,My husband enjoys the idea of knowing his phone is more protected having this screen protector| A little pricey but better than having to replace the screen itself|
positive,5,I have these shields on all my electronics that they make them for| They are worth the extra cost| I have yet had to replace one| Some are well over 5 yrs|
positive,5,Through out the different cell phones through out the years| I've had different types of screen protection| I've found the zagg screen protects other the best|
negtive,2,This screen protector is way to expensive for the minimum coverage it offers| It doesn't cover the whole screen and it is very fragile| I was highly unimpressed|
positive,5,Easy to apply | Easy to remove should you need to| Be sure to register your product for free replacement + minor shipping handling
positive,4,Its well worth the money |||just dont care for the beveled edge as this makes it somewhat nonresponsive if your trying to touch something near the edge of the phone
positive,5,I have always protected my Phones with a screen protector| I tried the cheap route| You get what you pay for| I have found zagg screen protectors by far the very best|
positive,5,Zagg makes the best screen protectors by far| This was a Fathers day gift and my dad absolutely loves this since it covers the whole screen without any halo effect|
negtive,1,It says that it fits the galaxy seven| but does not seal all around the edges| The phone has a slight curve to it where the glass does not|
positive,5,I like the glass screens| better looking and ZAGG is guaranteed for life|I did get a new one from ZAGG| return the broken one and no cost|
negtive,2,I'm not one that drops my phone or anything out of the ordinary and within 2 weeks I have 2 nasty cracks/ chips in my screen protector near the home key :(
positive,5,I wouldn't own a Samsung Galaxy 7 without purchasing the glass screen protector - it can be a life safer| should I ever drop the phone| It's wonderful to have|
positive,5,My Zagg protective cover was damaged when I dropped the phone while running| The Zagg product did the job and protected my phone from damage|
positive,5,I constantly drop my phone & break the glass| At least with these glass protectors| it's easier to change the glass rather then the phone|
negtive,1,Since the GS7 screen has a slight curve to it| the screen protector was raised off the screen around the edges| This allowed dirt/dust to collect around the edges|
positive,5,Been using these for years| Great warranty - Only had to replace once when I dropped my phone| Did what it needed to do| Highly recommend - you will be very pleased|
negtive,1,The protector glass is no good it will not stick to none of the 4 sides creating air to get under the screen not giving you your 100% or 75% screen protection
positive,5,This screen protector is very good quality| My screen is crystal clear and the protector itself is very smooth so scrolling on the phone screen is very easy|
negtive,1,I wish I would have bought the plastic case because this glass case was a waste of time and money| It cracked and shatter cracked a few days after buying it|
negtive,1,This phone cover cracked within a month of purchase and my phone was not even dropped or damaged to crack it| It just started crumbling| I plan to return
positive,4,This screen protector has been a great way to keep my phone intact| I also have an Otter box case| but this really saves the screen from scratches| Easy to clean|
positive,5,this product has save my screen multiple times from scratches and possibly even a broken screen| I would def| recommend always having one of these on your phone|
positive,5,Was told about this screen protector by the salesman| So glad that I purchased it for my phone| Much better than the plastic one that comes with the case|
positive,5,This is an amazing product which has saved me hundreds of dollars| I have dropped my phone several times and the glass protector has taken the beating|
negtive,1,The company needs to try again| It has a lip on the edges and has started to crack the cover| Im very displeased that it doesn't properly cover the phone|
positive,5,Have used Zagg screen protectors for several generations of Samsung products| Saved the screen on my TAB A| never have had a problem with touch sensetivity|
negtive,3,This screen protector was ok but it does not fit the screen well and is lifting on the sides| Hopefully they will come out with a full coverage protector soon|
positive,5,Love how my phone looks now after scratchy previous appearance| I have confidence that it is well-protected during accidental drops|
negtive,3,This screen protector is very clear| Only negative has chipped on the edge after only a few months| The chips don't affect function just didn't expect it to chip|
negtive,3,Tried my hand at install of protector| Recommend paying to have store install| Glue picked up dust so now have between screen and protector| Not worth cost|
positive,4,product was good sales person not so much| I had the sales person put this on and it was wrong | Last one in the store had to come back an BB made it right
positive,4,Had it for 2 years and only cracked it once| But the cover still worked after getting that one crack in it|
positive,4,For the price| not bad| I went on the bestbuy website while I was being rung up and got it for the same sale price as the website had it| Good job BB
negtive,1,The best buy employee wanted to charge $7 to put on the screen protector| I had to put it on and it chipled within 2 weeks| Is now spidered all the way across|
negtive,1,Do not use if you are also using a cellphone case| It will peel off and when you try to reposition it guess what? It will crack and there goes $25|
negtive,2,I have one for my iPhone that I love| but the Galaxy S7 screen protector doesn’t fit on the phone edge to edge so it peeled off quickly|
negtive,3,For some reason the Samsung Galaxy S7 has a curved Edge in these edge does not flatten up against the curve screen around the edges I did not like that|
negtive,1,It took the geek squad 4 tries to get this on| they broke every time| They ordered anothe one| got it on and it fell off a week later|
negtive,1,Galaxy S7 glass does not fit correctly| the screen cracked days after installation| zagg known about the problem and will release a new version with curved glass
positive,5,Overall great product so far| It was easy to install| Clear glass and seems very durable| No complaints| definitely recommend|
positive,5,I started getting scratches on mine from my cars keys being in my pocket but they sent me a new one under the replacement warranty
negtive,2,The screen protector easily cracks This is the 2nd one I had installed and I have not dropped the phone| Discovered today there is a crack along the side|
negtive,3,For the Samsung S7 it doesn't have good response near the edges| Otherwise it is very clear and I wouldn't have a cell phone without it's protection|
positive,4,A little over priced being your paying so much for the phones| But with that you don't wanna not get it bc you want your expensive phone protected
positive,5,Zagg is always my preferred choice for screen protection| It doesn't affect the picture quality and is a great way to keep from breaking/scratching the screen|
negtive,1,Hardly made it more than a day before it started cracking then soon after it shattered in several places| Cut open my finger tips and left glass slivers
positive,5,Love how it protects phone surface| Had one on my previous phone| Make sure you register with Zagg to get free one if something happens to current one|
negtive,2,The glass protectors don't stick to good around the edge| The s7 not the s7 edge has a slight curve to the phone| which prevents it to stick all the way around|
positive,5,Accidently dropped it stepped on it and slid it across the parking lot face down and it still protected my screen however the screen saver otself was toast
positive,5,This was another great ZAGG purchase| My daughter is rough on her phone and this protector has helped us keep her phone in pristine condition|
positive,5,Recommended by sales representative|||best thing she could have recommended| Very durable and protects screen better than any other screen protector I've had|
positive,5,My daughter loves the phone! She is able to video chat with me when she is away| The user interface is easy for her to use and just an all around good phone|
negtive,1,I was told it wouldn't break| Never dropped my phone and the corner cracked and broke off| Didn't hug the screen of my s7 the way it was supposed to
negtive,3,There is a flaw in the design of this product| It tends to stick up along the outer edge| Unfortunate because it's an excellent product otherwise|
negtive,2,Glass is super thin and chipped second day I had it and didn't even drop my phone just from when in my purse| Glass needs to be thicker so won't chip so easily
negtive,3,It has worked tremendously well| because I have dropped it and the glass has cracked already but the phone is definitely protected!
positive,5,This is a must have for anyone who owns a smartphone| The shield protects the screen from damage and scratching| Excellent price for the protection|
positive,5,bought two and really is excellent| sceen looks as if nothing is there| they even replaced the one we messed up putting on| they stick to there products quality
negtive,3,The edges of the screen protector do not adher to the phone surface well| as the phone edges recede back| I will be returning to the store|
negtive,2,Haven't even dropped my phone and its cracking| man at store put it on my phone not sure if it wasnt put on correctly or its the product
positive,5,This Zagg Glass Screen is awesome for protection against screen breakage| I have dropped my phone 2x & this screen protector did not even crack ! I love it|
positive,5,Have been using Zagg for many years| there products do a great job and this is a must for an expensive smart phone
positive,4,Applied this as a little extra protection even though the screens on these phones are tough| Easy to apply if you take your time and follow directions|
positive,5,This shield has been put to the test in a few different ways| It has saved the screen from shattering and allows for easy cleaning of the screen without worry|
positive,5,This glass case has helped to protect my phone for longer than any other phone I have ever had befor|
negtive,3,Down side is that it started chipping from normal wear and tear| First chip was a week from when I brought| Good thing is that it has a lifetime warranty
negtive,1,This screen protector was installed at Best Buy| Within a week| it started to come up at the sides| After two weeks| it cracked and I took it off|
negtive,1,This protector sti;l; has the halo effect around the screen that the last one did| Given the price you would think that maybe they would shape it to the phone|
positive,5,I LOVE THEIR GUARANTEE| IF YOUR PHONE FALLS AND THE PROTECTOR CRACKS| THEY WILL SEND AT NO CHARGE| HOPE I NEVER NEED TO CONTACT THEM FOR A REPLACEMENT
positive,5,If you have a smart phone the purchase of the Zagg glass shields are well worth the price| It has saved my phone on many occasions from a cracked screen|
negtive,1,Glass cover shield cracked in 2 days along the edge| Sent in for a replacement |May not install the other one since my case is doing the job|
negtive,3,Already had to order replacement because something chipped the edge| I'm very careful to protect the screen but maybe it's more durable than I realize|
positive,4,Bought the screen protector online and works fine| It doesn't cover the phone's screen edge to edge but covers about 98% of the screen|
positive,5,I love these protectors| They hold up to the bumps and drops my phone will occasionally take and *knock on wood* I haven't had a broken screen yet|
positive,4,i had to buy it as it was on a discount| but its a must have especially if you use the phone without otterbox or bumper case
positive,5,I like that this case does not affect the touch screen| It cleans easily and does not come off like the plastic protectors| It so much better!
positive,4,I was totally unfamiliar with this problem before having it applied to my new phone| So far| I have been happy with the protection it has provided|
negtive,1,just a way to waste of money| Instead get Geek Squad protection for any eventualities| Terrible instructions and just another ploy|
negtive,2,This screen protector claims it is sturdy and protects your phone| What a joke| I have gone through 2 of these and I never have dropped or smashed my phone|
negtive,1,Does not cover the entire screen| Small border the entire way around| Returned the first one and the replacement was the same|
positive,5,Found this screen proctecter on sale at Best Buy| The glass protects the cell phone screen better than the plastic film and has a lifetime warreny!
positive,5,I purchased the Zagg screen protector for my new phone because the one on my previous phone gave it great protection|
negtive,3,Typically I love the Zagg products| but I don't like it for the iPhones-it doesn't cover enough of the glass causing the edges to lift and bubble
negtive,2,It fits kind of funny? I mean it's on for now but about 1/4 of an inch doesn't really stick||i already have two small chips on the edge?
positive,5,I luv the InvisibleShield glass Screen protector for my galaxy s7 || Awesome product || has protected my phone up to now || do recommend it
positive,4,It does a good job protecting my phone and I like the feel of it but disappointed in Zagg for not taking in to consideration the rounded edges of the phone|
positive,5,I hesitated to buy this screen protector because of the price but it is terrific! No air bubbles| always clear| and great protection for my phone|
negtive,3,The side chipped after one day of using| Sent back through warranty it was easy | Phone is curved so screen did not fit on sides dust got under looks dirty
positive,4,I really liked it| and then I dropped it on a tile floor| It now has a spider web break in the corner| But that's better than a crack on the phone's screen!
positive,4,I am happy that the protectors no longer feel like rubber| So far it is doing it's job and looks great| Knock on wood that I don't need to test it's limits|
positive,5,I love Zagg| The associate put the protector on for me| Great customer service| Phone has dropped numerous of times and phone dont have a mark on it
positive,5,This stuff is the greatest you can ever buy! I had it on my LG G3 and it saved my screen countless times| it is a necessity| So far no issues on the s7
negtive,3,This shield is good but overall I don't like it| I crackled it within the first week and it's very sensitive to the smallest fall| Will not purchase again|
negtive,1,After 3 days this screen protector has already lifted in 3 areas| I would not recommend purchasing this product|
positive,5,I had Zagg screen protector on my other phone & it definitely worked! Saved my screen & replacement was simple| Would not have a phone without it1
positive,5,I dropped my phone and the screen protector worked as it said it would| Just a small scratch on the corner of the protector| My screen has no damage| Great!
negtive,3,I bought this item on Black Friday and it cracked before Christmas| it has protected my phone and I do have a warranty| but it is just disappointing
positive,5,I like this glass one a lot better than the usual film screen protectors| Much easier to apply & I don't need to clean off the finger printsas much|
positive,5,I like this screen protector because it actually works| The clarity is great and if necessary the protector will break before your phone screen does
positive,4,Has protected my screen from some drops| but does crack on the edge| probably from change in my pocket| Can see the phone screen much more clearly
positive,4,Good protection for expensive iPhone although there is a slight lift happening on the edge
positive,5,I have used other screen shields and I was not happy with them however| this one seems great| No fog| wrinkles| bubbles| or discoloration have developed|
positive,5,Great Product| Love the glass| Used this on my iPhone| This one was for one of my children| So I know the replacement of this will be easy| if needed|
positive,5,I have really put this to good use| I have fsent the cover back twice for replacement| what a great deal and great protection
positive,4,I haven't dropped my phone yet| so not sure how protective this is in that situation| but it seems like decent protection as best I can tell|
positive,4,Its durable| I bought mine and it was slightly cracked| I was told that the zagg company gives me a life time warranty
negtive,2,It isn't made like the one I had for my S4| This one is easily cracks| My phone screen protector has already about 5 cracks in it| Looks horrible|
positive,4,I got this one for my Samsung since the one that came at Costco for my phone didn't fit the screen completely| This one fit perfectly so I am very happy!
negtive,1,I took the 1st one back| then got a 2nd one ans applied it| The sides do not adhere to the cell phoneIt does not look good
negtive,1,After a week of having this on my phone it started to crumble into little shards of glass and 1 month later was a giant crack all the way down it|
positive,4,Protects the face of the samsung s7 phone but with the round edge shape it does not cover the edges of the phone ||but better than not having one at all
negtive,3,The product is o where as durable as I had thought it would be| Because of the slight curve to the screen the edges are easily damaged|
positive,5,Well what more can I say besides you will definitely need this going through day to day activities| It's like having a second screen on your phone|
positive,5,I purchased this screen protector and had it installed by a best buy associate| It was installed properly and so far I like it|
negtive,1,Crowning around the edges on my GS7| Seriously| make a screen protector that fits|||how embarrassing| I wish I would NOT have bought this|
negtive,2,I like the glass feel| However the design of the screen protector is slightly faulty| The edges don't cover properly| Wait for the new design to come out|
positive,5,I have always used zagg for any of my phones| but this is the best ever| After dropping my phone it landed face down and did not crack or break|
positive,5,My last phone got totally scratched up because I did not want to pay for the glass protector I would recommend this to anybody who buys a Samsung phone
positive,5,Got the glass shield for my galaxy s7| I have dropped it a few times and the shield is cracked but my phone is fine| It does the job as promised!!!
positive,5,I purchase Zagg for all my devices as well as for my family| They have quality products| fair price| stand behind their product with replacements|
positive,5,Have used zagg screen protectors on my last 3 smart phones| Only had a problem once and zagg replaced the protector no charge no questions asked|
positive,5,This is a great product for the price| easy to clean| doesn't add a lot of weight to the phone| good protection? I've dropped phone a few times|||
positive,5,Really like having the glass protector instead of the standard plastic| Looks better and doesn't get all the small scratches plastic screen protectors do|
positive,5,They are awesome and a great way to protect your phone| Give them a try they are great and worth the money to protect your phone rather than replace it|
positive,5,I'm pretty rough on my phones and since buying this cover I have dropped my phone a few times and no damage has been done to the screen at all|
positive,5,Good overall protection for your phone| Not the cheapest| but certainly not the most expensive|
positive,4,Purchased this protector in store| The staff helped me put in on the phone| It does the job| Would've given it 5 stars if it weren't so expensive|
positive,5,My son got this phone| He is very picky about technology| yet| he hasn't said one negative about it| He keeps raving about all it can do| Very pleased|
positive,5,Shield much clearer| Can't tell it is one the phone| Looks like the regular phone screen| I did not feel I should have paid $8 to have it put on though|
negtive,2,Purchased to protect my new phone| Phone slipped off the couch and feel onto carpeted floor| BIG CRACK| Not worth the money if it brakes so easily|
positive,5,It was for my son's phone and I know with the glass screen protector is better than the plastic in keeping the phone screen itself protected
negtive,3,Its not great at all| The screwn looks better in the glass but mine cracked 3days after having it| For the price of the glass i will buy the plastic one|
positive,5,It doesn't fit my phone the right e way is the only bad thing about it| I hand had to take it back into store because the edges were not made to for size
positive,5,This was a replacement for a screen that cracked and saved my phone| It's high quality and provides excellent protection|
positive,4,This screen protector works perfectly for protecting your phone| I would recommend having the store apply it without any previous experience|
positive,5,I have not dropped the phone yet so I have not really tested it but it was put on by the Geek Squad and they did a great job and it works perfect|
positive,4,Good screen protection| Comes in handy if you have things in pocket| I would much rather have this crack the the actual phone screen|
positive,5,They installed this for me for free at the store| Installation was very easy and thus far it has remained as looking and protected my screen
negtive,2,Crack without doing anything to it within 4 days| I purchased because the store spoke very highly about this item and i woyld never buy iy again|
negtive,3,Zagg made this shield knowing it would have the halo effect| and still charged 40 bucks| Then the new shield "curved" to fit will cost you another $45|
positive,5,Works great for keeping your screen from any damages| plus comes with lifetime warranty| Very easy to replace with the warranty|
positive,4,Fits well| but doesn't cover the screen right around the edge since the screen is slightly curved|
positive,5,I will only use glass screens on our phones to protect them and this one was a good price and was easy to put on| I am happy with my purchase|
positive,4,It's great! My 11yr| Old is very clumpsy at at times and dropped his phone several times| and this screen does a nice job protecting his screen|
positive,4,Its good because i like this product as it has always protected the phone| but the glass does not seal/stick around the edges of the phone
negtive,1,Only had it on my phone a month and a half and the edges of the screen protector are chipping away and leaving sharp edges that can cut|
negtive,1,Good because its a Zagg| But Zagg has a curved Zagg for GS7 that fits perfectly and looks better| No raised areas| This one cracks easy|
positive,5,The sales person put it on for me at the store and it is really great! There is an edge that can be a dust catcher| but not a really big deal|
negtive,1,There is a bubble between the screen and protector| It's a design flaw and Zagg is aware| Was hoping a recall would be out by now| Waste of money!!
positive,5,Zagg makes incredible products| It's a must to go with any case that doesn't have screen protection| Plus I think it makes the screen pop even more!!
positive,5,After getting scratches and a cracked screen on my S5 I decided to protect my new S7| No scratches or cracks so far| Well worth the investment|
positive,5,I had the tech at Best Buy place the invisible screen protector on my phone| He knew and had more experience than I had| He did an excellent job|
negtive,1,The tempered glass doesn't fit on the S7| don't buy it| The edges lift| I wish I had read the reviews beforehand| Zagg released a bad product this time|
negtive,2,Followed the instructions and the screen protecter cracked along the edges| Returned under warranty and the replacement did the same thing|
positive,5,The glass Zagg screen protector is not only fantastic| it is guaranteed and will be replaced for free if it cracks from dropping the phone|
positive,5,Dropped phone| and screen protector cracked but saved my phone screen| Great product !
positive,5,ZAGG makes some of the best and most premier products available for electronic devices! Their glass is unparalleled! Not to mention that warranty!
positive,5,Just wanted more protection for my phone| Only minor issue is the edges where it won't seal all the way because of the curve of the screen|
negtive,2,Screen protector does not lay flat| Leaves gap at edge of screen| Screen protector caught on case and cracked in lass than a week|
positive,5,The Best Buy staff quickly and correctly placed the shield on my phone| The shield provides excellent protection for my Galaxy 7 phone|
positive,5,This Zagg screen protector is definitely worth buying| The protection is great and if you get it at sale price it's a plus|
positive,5,This glass protection is too legit| Dropped my S7 and i thought i broke the screen| But actually the glass protection took the hit| Worth the 40 bucks
negtive,1,It broke in the first six days! I carry it in my breast coat pocket so there was nothing to even make it break! Does not make sense|
positive,5,The protection is fantastic| The only issue is making sure you put it on the phone correctly otherwise you will get bubbles or lefts on the ends|
negtive,1,The screen protector had difficulty adhering immediately after the representative put it on| 6 months later| it is cracking along all the edges|
negtive,1,Supposed to fit my phone didn't has bubbles never went away | Rather have the plastic version glass not worth it to me since didn't fit right
negtive,1,I bought this screen protector for my wife's phone and it does not work well| I was never able to get it to stick to screen without bubbles|
positive,5,I was gonna get another lifeproof case but since my galaxy s7 is waterproof I got a zagg glass screen protector and a simple case| Nice fit|
positive,4,I love this protector and would probably love it more if it hadn't been installed backwards which caused the edges to begin crumbling on day 1|
positive,4,The phone has a curved edge on the glass so the screen protector did not adhere to it| The great thing is that I get another free one to put on it|
positive,5,Love this screen protector| Feels like the actual screen and doesn't bubble like the softer protectors| Geek squad installed and it is working great|
positive,5,The Zagg invisible shield glass protector is great| My young child dropped the cell phone numerous times and that protected the phone screen|
positive,5,Served its purpose and protected my phone screen| Zagg also replaced the shield when it cracked
positive,5,I have a 1 year that loves my phone| He's dropped it several times| The invisibleshield glass has saved my screen an amazing amount of times|
positive,5,Projects the phones screen pretty well if does kinda crack on the edges being that the actual phones screen has a slight curve to it
positive,5,I have used this product before and one had cracked| It was easy to replace| A replacement screen was no charge| Just had to pay shipping
positive,5,Every time I purchase a new phone I have a ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector| The screens have never been scratched or damaged|
negtive,2,My grandson had this case 3 days and it cracked| His watch hit it| Wouldn't think it would crack so easily
positive,4,I have had a couple of dropped phones| they cracked| This product prevents this from costing you repair bills|
positive,5,We use Zagg on all of our phones| One of the best part about Zagg is the warranty| I do feel for the price they should withhold a little better|
positive,5,I ordered this because my last phone got destroyed by the welding spatter at work| Put this on since ive had my S7 and it looks new to this day|
negtive,1,Dang||just dropped the phone on the floor and I have a shatter screen view now! Not at all sturdy||but I guess it may have saved the phone screen??!!
negtive,2,I bought 2 of these for 2 phones and the edges would not stick down all around the screen| It was annoying so I returned them
positive,5,Had this put on my new phone by Best Buy employee| Have only had phone and shield for less than a month| Hoping protection lasts for life of phone|
negtive,2,I would not buy again unless they redesign| I does not fit right around the beveled edge of the phone| Makes my new S7 look like cheap garbage
negtive,3,It's okay however it has a halo effect around the edge of my screen that drives me nuts| The phone is curved so I get why but still aggravating|
positive,4,The first time i dropped my phone the protector cracked would've wanted it to last longer for the price i paid but did its job my screen is ok
positive,4,Screen protector is very sturdy but expensive| It does come with a warranty though that you have to register| It does needs to be wiped clean
positive,5,this protector was recommended by my salesperson on the day of my phone purchase - and I am very happy and satisfied with it - very good purchase !
positive,5,my screen protector need to be replaced because mine cracked| instructions were easy to understand and i replaced it without any help|
positive,4,Purchased 2 of these| Have cracked it by dropping it but the warranty is great| Will be replaced and all i have to do is return the cracked one|
positive,5,This screen protector is really clear and doesn't smudge| I love it| The salesman in the store was very knowledgeable and very helpful|
positive,5,This is not the first time with Zagg| as usual install was easy and past use of the product shows the protection is top notch
positive,5,I drop my phone all the time| and the protective cover has cracks in it while doing what it is supposed to do| protecting the phone screen
positive,5,Great fit| very durable| With a clumsy family member| this is a must have!!! May seem expensive| but much cheaper than the insurance deductible|
negtive,2,It broke in 4 days but guaranteed for life| had a new one delivered in a week so I can get it replaced free at best buy| overall pleased|
negtive,3,I had to return it because it wasn’t good it cracked in two places like it was a default in it I took it back on the 7 th day
negtive,2,didnt have it on for a week and it already chipped from the edges| I have had other brands and it lasted a long time! this one not too great|
positive,5,This cover works very well| and the warranty is excellent| The only issue I have had is with the sides not sealing well| but overall this is great|
positive,4,good product but you have to remember to really press down on your screen| It is clear and smooth on the surface of the phone's window|
negtive,1,sucked| they put it on for me and waited until it was done to tell me it wouldn't lay over the sides and no I have a bunch of bubbles
negtive,2,The InvisibleShield does not adhere to the edge of the screen| creating a halo effect| Dust and dirt can get under the edge|
positive,4,I had the sales person put it on and can not even tell it is there| With how much we pay for a phone | it is relief knowing it has extra protection
negtive,2,We had shields on our Galaxy6s for 5 years with very little scratching| First week with the ones on the 7s and multiple scratches|
positive,5,This was my fifth Zagg purchase and would not buy any others| Have had great experience with Zagg and never had a screen scratch or chip|
positive,5,it does not fit the phone perfect around the edges| mine cracked and it was replaced by zagg just paid 5 bucks for shipping|
negtive,1,This glass does not work on the Galaxy S7| I contacted Zagg and they are aware of the problem and are reworking the item and will release it "soon"
positive,5,This is a great screen protector for my phone| I dropped my phone and there is a small crack in the screen protector but not my phone|
positive,5,This phone is the greatest! It's easy to use and easy to understand| All my info transferred and the guys (and gals) at Best Buy are great!
positive,4,I like zagg products and their warranty| I think it is a very good product and my only complaint is that I feel it is a little too expensive|
positive,5,Great screen protector| helps so my screen doesn't get cracked| Can't wait for the phone that doesn't need a screen protector though|
positive,5,The ZAGG invisible Shield is very good| The only thing is on the s7 it has the sides like the edge| It's not bad so you don't notice it|
positive,4,I always buy these for my devices| I already need to replace it but at least I have that as an option rather then having my phone destroyer
negtive,3,tried sliding it in a waterproof plastic pouch for cellphones and it pealed halfway off the face of the phone and had to be thrown away|
positive,5,Any and all Zagg items are amazing| They fit perfectly| and it ever breaks| they have a lifetime replacement| No questions asked|
positive,5,This product is a better option than most others| other than a flip cover| which my wife doesn't like| Keeps the screen protected|
negtive,3,Loved the glass screen protector then it chipped 3 days later| Will see how the warranty works| The cover chipped while putting it into my purse|
positive,5,We tried to go cheap and get off brand| Don't do it pay a little more get the best one|
positive,5,I have always added a protective screen shield to my phones| I estimate at least three times it has saved me from a broken or cracked screen|
negtive,3,I love the additional protection of the extra layer of glass however with the slight curve to the screen there is a halo effect on the edges|
negtive,1,It gets 1 star because it is clear| however| I have to keep replacing it| The shield does not seal properly along the edges amd keeps cracking|
positive,5,This is my 4th screen protector| I have only had to replace it on 1 device| I requested warranty replacement and received it promptly|
positive,4,May not be the most durable| but it works very well| It fits perfectly and was easy to apply to my phone| I am happy with this purchase|
positive,4,I recently dropped my phone on some gravel| The screen appeared to be shattered| but when I peeled back the glass shield| my screen was safe!
positive,4,Used the InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector on my last phone for years| Without question bought it for my new phone too|
negtive,3,The cover is still intact but my glass broke within a few days| At least it is holding the glass together until I can get a new cell phone|
positive,5,I wanted proven protection for my new Samsung S7 glass screen| This does it as advertised| Also| Best Buy applied the screen for me| flawlessly|
positive,4,Shields work great I have been using them for years but for s7 non edge they don't stick on sides
negtive,1,Doesnt fit the slight curve of the screen| You would figure this wouldve been fixed by now but it hasnt which is a major disappointment
positive,5,This screen protector is clear to make viewing sharp| Easy to keep clean by wiping easily with anything conveniently around|
negtive,3,it's a screen protector| not a lot to say about it| Although I agree with other reviewers wished it came all the way to the edges of the phone|
positive,5,this cover works well and is easy to install| It allows me to see everything on my screen and protects it from drops too !
negtive,3,Husband had it for 3 days and it barely bumped into something and cracked and chipped| I thought for the cost it would be a harder surface|
positive,5,Smashed the day lights out of my phone and at first glance it looked like the screen was toast but the zagg shield took the whole impact|
positive,4,Love zagg covers| have them on everyone I knows phone and its great and the better upgraded zagg cover better protection even from drops|
positive,5,Protects my screen very well| one of the kids dropped phone and i see that there is a crack| without the protector my phone would have been gone!
negtive,3,dropped once and now sharp edge from small crack| however| does have lifetime warranty and it did not allow my phone screen to be cracked|
positive,5,Great screen protector and it has a lifetime warranty| I cracked the screen protector but my phone screen still looks brand new|
positive,4,It doesn't seem to make tight contact around edges so sometimes the keys around the edges don't activate unless it hit them just right|
positive,4,I would have given 5 stars but it doesn’t seal all the way down on my phone because of the screen going down on the sides|
positive,5,I had the geek squad install the screen| which made that part easy| Screen is nice and clear| I am sure that it has prevented scratches already|
negtive,1,ZAGG has stopped selling this product on their website and is aware of the issue| Don't waste your money| Let them recall the defective product|
positive,4,Great product|||always love Zagg glass| but edges don't fit the S7 well & after 1 drop| glass cracked & broke on edge| Otherwise great product|

positive,5,Long battery life| Crisp clear sound| There is the Jaybird app that allows you to choose how you want to hear your music|
positive,4,There is still a thin line around the edges that never completely sealed down as I was told it would| Does not effect its functionality|
positive,5,I like that I literally can't detect that this screen protector is on my phone| but it offers protection from scratches|
positive,5,Got this for my new phone & happy I did| Dropped my phone the 2nd day I had it||||only chipped the edge of the "glass" & not my phone screen|
positive,5,The Zagg shield glass truly is invisible| It doesn't smudge or curl up like plastic screen covers I've had on previous phones| Worth the money!
positive,5,Great product| I was hesitant because it costs more than the plastic cover| It was worth it| Much clearer and seems to stay cleaner|
negtive,3,I have had this case for a month| While the main part of the screen has been great| I have 4 areas in the corners that are cracked|
positive,4,Nice product| but it's too bad it doesn't fit the edge of the screen of the galaxy S 7| Dirt is getting under it now| it's been a month|
positive,5,The screen protector was installed by the Best Buy phone salesman| It looks great on the phone|
negtive,3,My protector chipped on the edge within the first week| It cracked after only a couple of months| I'm not sure how this is better than plastic|
negtive,1,It does not stick well to the phone I cleaned it really good an did it perfect the first time but all around the screen it does not stick
positive,5,The Zagg - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for my Samsung Galaxy S7 was a great investment| I don't worry about shattering my screen|
negtive,1,With just one drop it breaks| The screen will not go in good a lot of air bubbles are left once you stick it to the phone|

positive,4,I would give it a 5 star but the edges of the protector are cracking up a little bit| It is still in good shape though| Not very bothersome|
negtive,3,Cannot see the screen in sunlight| Hard to keep clean and clear| could probably do just as well or better with a cheaper cover screen||
negtive,3,My screen shield cracked within a few weeks of having it put on| although they do have a lifetime warranty|
positive,4,I had a Zagg screen protector on my last phone| this one is thicker and it cracked with just a little bit of pressure| Not what I was expecting
positive,5,The tempered glass is amazingly smooth| and gives the phone the same HD quality| It helps that it gives the phone an extra layer of protection|

positive,5,This is one of many Zagg screen protectors my wife and I have owned| Great product| Great service if something goes wrong with the product|
positive,5,these are great screen protectors instead of the plastic you mostly use because these last a lot longer and do not pit like the plastic do
negtive,1,Love the feel of the glass over the plastice protectors| However because the S7 is curved on the sides the glass hang over and cracks easy|
positive,5,I had the ZAGG glass on my Galaxy S5 so when I purchased the S7 I automatically had the ZAGG glass put on to protect it as well great product
positive,5,I have been getting Androids for quite some time| Very user friendly for me| But most of all customer service at Best Buy is awesome
negtive,1,The edges on this protector are not curved| So they do not contour to the screen| Seems to significant effect touchscreen sensitivity|

negtive,2,we were told only option for S7 so bought it screen constantly foggy and fringerprinits and such hard to clean off will be replacing very soon

positive,5,I'm a big fan of Sam Smith so I love listening to his music! I like his style and his voice is very distinct which is good|

positive,5,This the best phone protector| I always buy one when I get a phone| due to it has lifetime warranty| You won't regret it|

positive,5,I always prefer a glass shield over a plastic one| It's almost like there's nothing there with it still being very protective
positive,4,Screen is not as pliable as i wished| Its a hard plastic and doesn't really hug and secure the edges of the screen
negtive,3,It looks more like 3d and so far so good not the best nor worst screen protector but I needed a reasonable price and this was it
positive,5,We really like the glass protector| bought another one for our other phone after seeing how well it worked|
positive,5,Love the fact that the sensitivity of screen is not effected and that fingerprint smudges seem to be a thing of the past|

positive,4,purchased one for all 3 phones in family|||||protection is great| would of given 5 stars if had just a little more grip|
negtive,3,I don't like that it doesn't cover the screen so with some of my games and other things I do it makes it a pain to use
negtive,1,Not as great as described| Mine developed air bubbles after a couple weeks| Do not like at all| Looking for something better|
negtive,2,While this was easily adhered to the phone the S7 has a beveled screen and the protector left a "halo" around the screen

negtive,1,This item is junk| I can't believe Zagg even shipped this screen protector out| You can't type and it won't stick|
positive,5,The screen somehow cracked we called company they sent us a better one for $3 and this one is the top of line so not a bad deal

positive,5,I really like the screen protector so far| It does not distort the screen like others protectors that I have had in the past|
negtive,1,Best Buy needs to stop selling this for the S7||| IT DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY! Wait for Zagg to release the Glass Contour instead|
negtive,3,The edges of the screen protector doesn't lay flat and chipped the first day| It was installed by a Best Buy Mobile Rep|

positive,4,Great quality the installation it's quick and easy you just need to really clean your phone before installation
positive,4,The protection is good just the edges of phone are curved so there's always lifted part on the sides| Dirt collects there/

positive,5,This is way better than the curved glass protector||| I have had it for almost four months now without a scratch|
positive,4,It has a good fit and so far has helped me to keep my cell phone out of scratches but it is a little bit pricey
negtive,2,It didn't go on very smooth and then once I had it on it didn't make it 2 days before the first corner started peeling up|
positive,5,Love my Samsung phone| The camera takes the best pictures| I am sold on Samsung products| and the great staff at best buy|
