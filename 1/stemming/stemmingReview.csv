i made the big mistak of not read the review for thi befor i bought it ive purchas zagg product befor and have alway been happyespeci with their screen protector i never purchas the glass protector befor but figur i would thi time around sinc i now have to worri about my phone with a new child sinc zagg ha alway been so great i didnt bother read the review boy wa that a mistak had a read the review ahead of time i would have not purchas the glass protector i purchas the s7 not the s7 edg but what some peopl dont realiz peopl who are claim that the review writer bought the s7 protector for the s7 edg is that there is a slight curv to the screen on the edg it veri subtl but it is there and i didnt even realiz it until i put the glass protector on and it didnt sit flat at the edg i kept tri to push it down think i just didnt appli enough pressur at the edg but if you squeez down harder on the edg itself then a bubbl start to form toward the middl as it the glass it cant bend to fit secur on the screen so onc i put pressur on the edg it wa forc to keep it form and come up in other place to achiev that state my photo show where the protector didnt seal against the screen along the edgewher it seal it black and where it gray is where it not seal i am veri disappoint with zagg on thi product becaus had they actual test thi on a unit they would have realiz it wouldnt work and not sell it seem like the just got the measur of the phone and just creat the screen protector for it im go to return thi to best buy and purchas the hd screen protectorof cours after read the review i see that zagg is go to come out with a curv glass protector for both the new s7 phone but until then i will need someth to protect the screen ,positive
the zagg glass cover my regular samsung s7 is terrif with one major drawback it seem that even my regular s7 ha a slight curv in the screen on the long edg therefor the last 18 or so of the side of the zagg glass cover are not realli touch the screen if you dont have a case or if your case doesnt have tall enough side to protect the screen you will find yourself touch those area and inevit make fingeredgeshap break in the glass thi can not be help the glass is hang there off the screen these break onli extend as far as the rais part of the cover where it doe not touch the screen but realli now thi is not what i paid a premium price for i would have thought thi issu would have play into the design of the cover i fear that zagg will be replac thi cover more than onc over the phone lifetim ,negative
not the best fit around the edg as other have state the s7 non edg version doe have a slight bend around the edg of the glass so the zaag glass screen protector doe not fit well on the outsid edg it look like you didnt press the screen protector down or have an air bubbl on the edg but you dont the screen protector is constantli lift just a littl off the screen with a case on you dont notic it as much but if you tri to drag icon to the edg or use the edg of your phone it doesnt work until you press veri hard i purchas the non edg screen protector for the non edg s7 and it just doesnt live up to the zaaz qualiti you expect i gave it 1 star as it doe protect the screen from damag but make it hard to use the 2nd star is becaus of the ad bonu of collect all the lint in my pocket 2 photo are of the issu pen is not lift the screen protector just show where the edg is and the lift edg case on the phone is the spigen® ultra hybrid air cushion crystal clear ,positive
even after be assur by best buy rep who wa great btw did look at these review with me that thi thing would fit it doesnt not even a week later dustdirt under both side contact zagg who is now put one out that doe cover the edg zagg repli wa that thi is suppos to fit like thi that thi protector is suppos to have a halo effect on around the edg and that all of their product have a lift huh so then whi not advertis thi as such due to the s7 design inform your biggest retail that the side will not lay flat 700 phone i dont want some misfit piec of junk cover the screen and unfortun thi is all best buy ha to offer if you want to leav the store with a protector on zagg is inde put out a new one that promis to cover the side of both s7 and s7 edg i guess that a coincid and they are not go to exchang these defect that they claim are not defect they are offer an exchang for the exact same product so by that offer and their joke offer of free ship we should be exchang these weekli then major fail on zagg major fail for not let best buy rep know thi product is suppos to not lay flat and major fail for not be will to exchang them stay far away from thi mess unless you want to be 48 out 3999 plu instal you work too hard for your money dont throw it away ,negative
i have alway use recommend and even sold zagg screen protector as a wireless profession but i must admit these s7 invis shield glass suck think it wa an issu with the instal or possibl a defect product i email zagg they sent me a replac waiv ship cost and didnt requir that i sent them the origin shield back well after a week and a half i got the new one after i power it off and let it sit for 510 min i obsess clean my brand new s7 instal the new shield and let it sit overnight the next morn i awok to find the same halo or ring around my screen where the adhes didnt stick i email zagg 3 time more ask if i paid the differ and upgrad to the curv glass shield would it remedi my issu 10 day later and well outsid my orig 30 im still await an answer is thi realli what they provid a custom for 4499 i put my otterbox on it and left it on until i find a compani who make someth suitabl you made me sad zagg not cool all ,negative
i have use zagg screen protector for all my devic and if i need to replac my crack screen protector not a problem when i can just pay 5 for a replac i believ that thi is best screen protector on the market today the great thing about thi protector and not just thi protector from zagg but all their screen protector have a lifetim warranti after your purchas the screen protector the first thing you do is go to the zagg websit and regist the screen protector becaus if your screen protector ha happen to crack instead of have to buy a new one just login into the zagg websit and order a replac screen for onli 5 which cover ship or ship is free i dont rememb they will send you a screen protector onc you receiv in the mail go to best buy have them remov the old screen protector and put on the new screen protector then you send old screen protector back to zagg use the yellow envelop that they sent you in the mail though you spend a lot of money for the best screen protector on the market and if it crack order a replac for 5 and send in the old one without have to buy a new one each time i recommend get the glass screen protector not the plastic version i will say for the s7 screen protector that there a some batch of the product out there that have not work out the issu with fulli protect the screen with the short curv it ha i still doe the job becaus i have a case on my s7 you hardli notic it ,positive
let me say that i love samsung and the galaxi phone as well as zagg in the past i have had noth but great experi with both product and compani howev the new phone specif the galaxi s7 ha a bevel edg to the screen thi mean that the screen protector will not lay flat all the way to the edg the origin salesperson gave me the line that the screen protector would blend to the edg over time it ha been month and the edg are still off the glass and let me be clear the staff at best buy instal thi product i have kept the screen protector on but thi mean that dirt gather under the lip and it suffer from small fray and crack i have no idea what zagg would say if the glass broke probabl someth about it be my fault sinc the screen protector wa fray but it still provid protect for the phone i am just hope that with all of the engin mind at both compani they will come out with a screen protector that lay flat but as i am write thi the salesperson i recent spoke with say that it doesnt exist ,negative

when i origin bought thi product it wa 40 immedi after put it on the screen protector did not adher to my phone on the outsid edg at all i have a regular samsung galaxi s7 not s7 edg and i made sure to buy the right screen protector but when i put it on my phone there is at least a centimet or two on the entir outsid edg that is lift up and will not stick to the phone my friend had the same problem and even after order a replac the replac had the same exact issu as well befor order the replac i had the origin for two month and let me tell you there were crack everywher it would crack at the lightest drop bump scratch anyth honestli it crack much easier than the phone itself ever would and while that should be a good thing it wa just annoy becaus the entir outer edg is lift it super easi so get water or dust particl stuck underneath the screen protector overal thi purchas wa a mistak just stay with regular screen protectorsnot the glass one theyll save you a lot of money and frustrat ,negative

i want to clear up the complaint about the edg of the screen protector have a haze or not make complet contact it is true howev there is more to the stori first the reason thi is occur is the new s7 design ha a round corner along the edg not the s7 edg the regular s7 thi soften the edg zagg fail to take thi into account when they releas the screen protector one option would have been to slightli shrink the size to match the flat surfac and not extend over the curv portion of the screen that is the reason you have poor or no contact around the edg is thi import with your screen off black you can see it when the screen is on you can not see it also if you have someth like an otter skin or tech21 protector on your phone it hide it even more it is aggrav zagg did not account for thi but the safeti and protect deliv by thi glass screen protector is superior to anyth els i have seen i had one on my s6 for the last year and it look like the day i bought it dont let the complaint about the edg discourag you mayb zagg will react quickli and releas and updat version that address thi ,negative

i gave 5 star becaus the product itself is great in my opinion i love zagg glass screen protector but thi one is not the right fit for the galaxi s7 due to the slight curv on the side of the phone the shield stay uplift on the side which caus the shield to crack on the bottom right edg of the screen protector be that it doe not lay flat on the phone screen it wa instal at best buy at the time of purchas i will definit continu to buy zagg glass screen protector again for my other product but not for thi phone unless the protector is slightli curv like the phone i would recommend thi product but not for thi phone ,positive

if you can get it on the phone right and i mean if thi is an excel screen protector the nicest thing about it is it is actual made of glass so you preserv the feel of the face of the phone and it veri friendli to the touch the downsid is you have to be extrem care put it on you pretti much have one chanc if you get a singl speck of dust under thi thing or if it goe on slightli crook or anyth like that your go to have a bubbl and it go to drive you insan until you buy the next one they do have a warranti and they better for 50 buck you have to send it in to get the exchang though i much prefer the store brand if it avail i bought thi one that particular day becaus they were out of stock the store brand screen protector which i believ is by insignia it ha plenti of clean materi and also it ha a plastic guid to aid in instal ive done two of them on my other phone and they work perfectli everi time and theyr half the price ,positive

the issu of thi screen protector not fit the galaxi s7 ha been well document in review so i will not reiter the issu zagg mess up on thi one and should have recal thi product long ago especi for the price zagg websit no longer list thi product for the s7 as they now have a curv glass protector for the s7 and s7 edg i call zagg and they will replac thi screen protector for the new curv one but there is current one issu with the new one the new curv glass protector onli come in opaqu black the screen is obvious clear but the portion that cover the color portion of the face is opaqu so your gold platinum or other color phone is cover and will have a black face fyi bb doe not carri the new curv zagg product to be fair the old product will work and protect your screen if you do not mind the halo effect zagg should lower the price of thi product consider to compens ,positive
thi screen protector isnt perfect but it realli isnt the fault of the protector samsung decis to slightli curv the side of the s7 screen make find a good glass screen protector difficult ive own 2 protector that seal to the screen fulli but they didnt cover the whole view screen and left annoy edg on the on the touch screen the zagg protector cover the entir view screen but doe not seal to it complet becaus of the curv the edg of the screen are respons more protect and i dont notic the edg not be fulli seal it also fit well with a speck case or an otter defenderzagg doe now make a curv protector but it is consider more expens and some review say it is tough to put a case on with the curv protector instal as long as i own an s7 thi zagg is my choic ,positive
i purchas thi glass screen protector know full well what the review were on it but i felt i did not have a choic as you never know what will happen to your phone overal it doe the job but there are 2 signific issu you should be awar of that are frustrat at time but in my opinion should not prevent you from buy the product issu 1 is that you will get a halo effect around the edg of the display as the galaxi s7 screen is slightli curv along with thi halo effect the screen protector can get a littl dirti around the edg but it ha been veri minor for me the second issu and mayb the bigger problem of the 2 is that the touch screen sensit is made less in certain area which can drive you crazi at time slide down notif from the top or press ani button around the edg typic requir y a harder press thi be said it is probabl still the best option for protect your s7 ,negative
thi screen protector ha a great feel and doe an awesom job at resist oilsmudg the onli problem is that it doe not fit the slightli bevel edg of the galaxi s7 nonedg the result is a halo effect a quick onlin search will show thi is a univers problem due to a design flaw around the edg of the phone which attract dirt and lint under it almost immedi i would recommend find a more temporari perhap nonglass version until zagg updat their design to accommod the edg of thi phoneand rememb best buy at least in woodbridg va will charg you about 8 to instal one of these screen protector even if you purchas the brand new phone from them complain about the fitment of the protector befor you leav and get told to just bring it back and well replac it if the fit doesnt resolv itself after a coupl day ,negative

i made the big mistak of not read the review for thi befor i bought it ive purchas zagg product befor and have alway been happyespeci with their screen protector i never purchas the glass protector befor but figur i would thi time around sinc i now have to worri about my phone with a new child sinc zagg ha alway been so great i didnt bother read the review boy wa that a mistak had a read the review ahead of time i would have not purchas the glass protector i purchas the s7 not the s7 edg but what some peopl dont realiz peopl who are claim that the review writer bought the s7 protector for the s7 edg is that there is a slight curv to the screen on the edg it veri subtl but it is there and i didnt even realiz it until i put the glass protector on and it didnt sit flat at the edg i kept tri to push it down think i just didnt appli enough pressur at the edg but if you squeez down harder on the edg itself then a bubbl start to form toward the middl as it the glass it cant bend to fit secur on the screen so onc i put pressur on the edg it wa forc to keep it form and come up in other place to achiev that state my photo show where the protector didnt seal against the screen along the edgewher it seal it black and where it gray is where it not seal i am veri disappoint with zagg on thi product becaus had they actual test thi on a unit they would have realiz it wouldnt work and not sell it seem like the just got the measur of the phone and just creat the screen protector for it im go to return thi to best buy and purchas the hd screen protectorof cours after read the review i see that zagg is go to come out with a curv glass protector for both the new s7 phone but until then i will need someth to protect the screen ,positive
the zagg glass cover my regular samsung s7 is terrif with one major drawback it seem that even my regular s7 ha a slight curv in the screen on the long edg therefor the last 18 or so of the side of the zagg glass cover are not realli touch the screen if you dont have a case or if your case doesnt have tall enough side to protect the screen you will find yourself touch those area and inevit make fingeredgeshap break in the glass thi can not be help the glass is hang there off the screen these break onli extend as far as the rais part of the cover where it doe not touch the screen but realli now thi is not what i paid a premium price for i would have thought thi issu would have play into the design of the cover i fear that zagg will be replac thi cover more than onc over the phone lifetim ,negative
not the best fit around the edg as other have state the s7 non edg version doe have a slight bend around the edg of the glass so the zaag glass screen protector doe not fit well on the outsid edg it look like you didnt press the screen protector down or have an air bubbl on the edg but you dont the screen protector is constantli lift just a littl off the screen with a case on you dont notic it as much but if you tri to drag icon to the edg or use the edg of your phone it doesnt work until you press veri hard i purchas the non edg screen protector for the non edg s7 and it just doesnt live up to the zaaz qualiti you expect i gave it 1 star as it doe protect the screen from damag but make it hard to use the 2nd star is becaus of the ad bonu of collect all the lint in my pocket 2 photo are of the issu pen is not lift the screen protector just show where the edg is and the lift edg case on the phone is the spigen® ultra hybrid air cushion crystal clear ,positive
even after be assur by best buy rep who wa great btw did look at these review with me that thi thing would fit it doesnt not even a week later dustdirt under both side contact zagg who is now put one out that doe cover the edg zagg repli wa that thi is suppos to fit like thi that thi protector is suppos to have a halo effect on around the edg and that all of their product have a lift huh so then whi not advertis thi as such due to the s7 design inform your biggest retail that the side will not lay flat 700 phone i dont want some misfit piec of junk cover the screen and unfortun thi is all best buy ha to offer if you want to leav the store with a protector on zagg is inde put out a new one that promis to cover the side of both s7 and s7 edg i guess that a coincid and they are not go to exchang these defect that they claim are not defect they are offer an exchang for the exact same product so by that offer and their joke offer of free ship we should be exchang these weekli then major fail on zagg major fail for not let best buy rep know thi product is suppos to not lay flat and major fail for not be will to exchang them stay far away from thi mess unless you want to be 48 out 3999 plu instal you work too hard for your money dont throw it away ,negative

i want to clear up the complaint about the edg of the screen protector have a haze or not make complet contact it is true howev there is more to the stori first the reason thi is occur is the new s7 design ha a round corner along the edg not the s7 edg the regular s7 thi soften the edg zagg fail to take thi into account when they releas the screen protector one option would have been to slightli shrink the size to match the flat surfac and not extend over the curv portion of the screen that is the reason you have poor or no contact around the edg is thi import with your screen off black you can see it when the screen is on you can not see it also if you have someth like an otter skin or tech21 protector on your phone it hide it even more it is aggrav zagg did not account for thi but the safeti and protect deliv by thi glass screen protector is superior to anyth els i have seen i had one on my s6 for the last year and it look like the day i bought it dont let the complaint about the edg discourag you mayb zagg will react quickli and releas and updat version that address thi ,negative

i gave 5 star becaus the product itself is great in my opinion i love zagg glass screen protector but thi one is not the right fit for the galaxi s7 due to the slight curv on the side of the phone the shield stay uplift on the side which caus the shield to crack on the bottom right edg of the screen protector be that it doe not lay flat on the phone screen it wa instal at best buy at the time of purchas i will definit continu to buy zagg glass screen protector again for my other product but not for thi phone unless the protector is slightli curv like the phone i would recommend thi product but not for thi phone ,positive

the issu of thi screen protector not fit the galaxi s7 ha been well document in review so i will not reiter the issu zagg mess up on thi one and should have recal thi product long ago especi for the price zagg websit no longer list thi product for the s7 as they now have a curv glass protector for the s7 and s7 edg i call zagg and they will replac thi screen protector for the new curv one but there is current one issu with the new one the new curv glass protector onli come in opaqu black the screen is obvious clear but the portion that cover the color portion of the face is opaqu so your gold platinum or other color phone is cover and will have a black face fyi bb doe not carri the new curv zagg product to be fair the old product will work and protect your screen if you do not mind the halo effect zagg should lower the price of thi product consider to compens ,positive
thi screen protector isnt perfect but it realli isnt the fault of the protector samsung decis to slightli curv the side of the s7 screen make find a good glass screen protector difficult ive own 2 protector that seal to the screen fulli but they didnt cover the whole view screen and left annoy edg on the on the touch screen the zagg protector cover the entir view screen but doe not seal to it complet becaus of the curv the edg of the screen are respons more protect and i dont notic the edg not be fulli seal it also fit well with a speck case or an otter defenderzagg doe now make a curv protector but it is consider more expens and some review say it is tough to put a case on with the curv protector instal as long as i own an s7 thi zagg is my choic ,positive
i purchas thi glass screen protector know full well what the review were on it but i felt i did not have a choic as you never know what will happen to your phone overal it doe the job but there are 2 signific issu you should be awar of that are frustrat at time but in my opinion should not prevent you from buy the product issu 1 is that you will get a halo effect around the edg of the display as the galaxi s7 screen is slightli curv along with thi halo effect the screen protector can get a littl dirti around the edg but it ha been veri minor for me the second issu and mayb the bigger problem of the 2 is that the touch screen sensit is made less in certain area which can drive you crazi at time slide down notif from the top or press ani button around the edg typic requir y a harder press thi be said it is probabl still the best option for protect your s7 ,negative
thi screen protector ha a great feel and doe an awesom job at resist oilsmudg the onli problem is that it doe not fit the slightli bevel edg of the galaxi s7 nonedg the result is a halo effect a quick onlin search will show thi is a univers problem due to a design flaw around the edg of the phone which attract dirt and lint under it almost immedi i would recommend find a more temporari perhap nonglass version until zagg updat their design to accommod the edg of thi phoneand rememb best buy at least in woodbridg va will charg you about 8 to instal one of these screen protector even if you purchas the brand new phone from them complain about the fitment of the protector befor you leav and get told to just bring it back and well replac it if the fit doesnt resolv itself after a coupl day ,negative

thi is just a patch that zagg releas earli as a way to get peopl to buy a screen protector they know doesnt fit zagg support say a contour one will releas begin of april so wait until then to get one best buy should put out a notic in the meantim that you are purchas a faulti product should just buy a case with a screen shield until then unless you dont mind dust collector and scratch yourself on the screen protector ,negative
zagg just announc that the curv version of thi protector is now avail i recommend purchas that protector insteady even the nonedg version of the s7 ha a slight curv at the l r edg and sinc thi protector is flat it separ from the screen at the edg the best buy associ use the euphem of it be a halo effect but did not tell me about thi featur until after i purchas it and had them instal it if it were onli cosmet it would not bother me that much howev realiz that where the protector doe not touch the screen the touch screen will obvious be inop so thing like drag icon from one home screen to the next is difficult unless you press down hard when do so ,negative
