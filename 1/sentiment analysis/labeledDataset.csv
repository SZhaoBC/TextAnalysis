Samsung threw a curve with the standard Galaxy S7 Like the S6 the S7 looks flat but unlike the S6 the S7 screen has is a slight curve down on the edges Zagg has established a great reputation for producing some of the best screen protectors out there This is why I purchased the Zagg Invisible Shield Glass which says on the box it is for the Galaxy S7 not Edge but it will not fit properly Because of the slight curve of the S7 screen at the edges the Glass screen protector can not adhere to the edge leaving a halo effect about one eighth of an inch around the edges From my research I found this issue has been documented on the web since last spring Zagg no longer offers this screen protector for the S7 on their website yet they never recalled the millions of units still out there nor have they informed the retailers this item will not fit the S7 according to my Best Buy Associate Zagg now offers the Glass Curve for the S7 which Best Buy does not offer at this time However the screen protector only comes in BLACK The screen portion is clear with black opaque top and bottom that will cover the color portion of the phone Now if you have a standard black phone not a major issue If you have a colored phone the color of the phone is covered and you now have a black phone Also many have complained that the new Glass Curve makes the touch screen less sensitive requiring multiple swipes and harder pressure Others have complained the edge of the Glass Curve shield will eventually lift from the screenThere are pros and cons to using a screen protector with todays Gorilla Glass 4 As far as film type protectors I dont think they are necessary for todays screens as they reduce the quality of the screen touch and view and offer no real protection for screen breakage As for the Glass type protectors I do believe they offer protection for screen breakage while keeping the touch and view qualities of the screen In fairness to BB and Zagg BB offered to returnrefund and Zagg offered to replace with the new Curve Glass when available I bought my Zagg as part of an accessory bundle and if refunded I lose my discount on the other items in the bundle I do not want a BLACK screen protector and it is unknown if Zagg will produce a clear version of the Glass Curve The Invisible Shield Glass I have now functions feels right to the touch does not diminish the sensitivity of the screen and the halo on the edge is only noticeable when the screen has a dark image or is off I would only recommend this screen protector for the S7 if you can get it at an extreme discount as it will still protect I highly recommend the Invisible Shield Glass for any device it actually fits ,positive
Bought both the s7 and the Zagg InvisiSheild Glass Actually I bought two of the Zagg products but not because I wanted to Let me explain I bought the phone and screen protector though the screen protector was at a different store It was close by so i paid for it and picked it up I came home and attempted to install using the easy install tabs First when I followed the instructions and executed Step 2 Remove protective film at 1 icon the actual screen protector oilresistant nano coating and scratch resistant tempered glass layer had separated from the Premium screen protection layer and the adhesive I didnt realize this because the screen protector and the protective film were indistinguishable from each other After several attempts of installing the protectors glass adhesive layer not realizing the protector was already destroyed and useless because the main protection layer was not attached to the Glass and adhesive layers I kept noticing the edges wouldnt lay down In attempting to seal them I like several other reviewers ended up creating bubles in the main viewing area In the process of trying to correct that I ripped the adhesive layer and had no screen protection I went back to Best Buy thinking it was all my fault when in fact even if it had laid down good the product was defective in the box I bought a 2nd screen protector and this time I paid BestBuy to do it Its on but it doesnt look like it is You can see a gap between the s7s beveled edge and the flat screen protector My phone and screen protector are less than two days old and because of the edges of the protector not clinging to the edge of the device There are tons of dust and other stuff clinging to that edge of exposed adhesive and with part of the screen edge exposed does the screen protector actually provide the level of protection it is intended to Absolutely not This was a bad release period It feels like they took one of the other protectors for a flat phone and branded it for the s7 to avoid not having a product when the phone released while they try and fix it with a curved glass s7 model Im really hoping that Zagg will honor their Guarantee and fix this problem for me I have purchased Zagg protection for every device I have Tab s 2x s5 s7 2x Nooks etc In every situation with the exception of the Galaxy s7 I was thrilled with how the other Zagg products performed ease of installation and overall quality I installed them easily and without any bubbles on my 10 Tab S 9 Nooks and my s5s This s7 protector is not good ,positive
I used to go commando no screen protection and no caseuntil I dropped my fortunately very inexpensive and old Motorola phone 2ft onto the street as I was getting out of my car I cant tell you how many times Ive done that but this was the last drop The screen was completely destroyed Lucky me I was due for an upgrade Ultimately I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S7 normal style not the Edge For outer protection I picked up a TECH21 EVO Check case for which I did read reviewslots and lots of reviews and its perfect For the screen I bought this Zagg Glass Screen Protectorwithout reading reviews Even as I type this I still havent read what others are saying about it Instead I went on the recommendation from the Best Buy Employee At home excited to play with my new toy I applied the glass screen to my new phone I didnt have much trouble aligning it and the yellow peel this side off firstdont touch the adhesive side message was as clear and concise as could be Then came the disappointmentthe S7 has a slight curve to it and the glass shield did not lay flat on the left and right edges I could immediately see the potential for lint dust and funk to collect under this 18 lip on both sides I thought I installed it wrong So I got online registered my shield and then called Zagg for installation support After looking me up in their system and hearing my complaint the Zagg employee was quick to admit that this was a known problem She confirmed that I had in fact correctly installed the shield and then informed me that they have developed a shield to match my phone She further explained that Zagg had not yet pulled all units back from the sales floors and that they will replace my purchase for free After collectingconfirming my info she waived the shipping and mailed me via USPS the correct Glass Curve Shield model GS7CGCBK0 While there was no additional money out of my pocket the replacement took 29 days to arrive I couldnt find my replacement here on Best Buys website I have a feeling that Zagg still hasnt formally released it Heres my 4star review for thatPatience a steady hand perfect vision and a dust free environment is HIGHLY recommended for installation The Glass Curve Invisible Shield for the Samsung Galaxy S7 fits perfectly on all edges The bordertrim has a black finish that helps to hide the fact that you have a screen protector at all which I love However the symbols for the Home button and the Back button the white backlit capacitive buttons on the bottom left and right of the phone are covered by the glass shield and its black finish Etched through the black are the exact shapes for said buttons Any error in placement of the glass shield will coverup andor block the backlight from these buttons Applying this shield made me feel like the nervous bomb squad guy trying to cut the correct wire Steady Focus Easy now Easy As if worrying that I hadnt cleared the screen of finger prints and dust wasnt enough I was in a panic about correctly aligning the shield Theres probably a way to do it but I couldnt figure out how to keep the Home and Back buttons on so I could see the light as I aligned the shield And so I did have to lift it back up once to correctly fit Zagg should have instructions to do the followingAfter cleaning and prepping to install the shield hold the bottom edge against the phone and align the Home and Back buttons then slowly lower the glass over the speaker and camera at the topAll said and done I really like the end results This screen protector blends in perfectly with the TECH21 EVO case SmokieBlack The finished look merits 5 stars but perfection is required for the install to phone and not everyone has dexterity 100 For that Id give it 3 stars However Zagg was friendly and compliant about the replacement so Im averaging that out to 4StarsGood Luck ,positive
I made the big mistake of not reading the reviews for this before I bought it Ive purchased Zagg products before and have always been happyespecially with their screen protectors I never purchased the glass protector before but figured I would this time around since I now have to worry about my phone with a new child Since Zagg has always been so great I didnt bother reading the reviews Boy was that a mistake Had a read the reviews ahead of time I would have not purchased the glass protector I purchased the S7 not the S7 edge but what some people dont realize people who are claiming that the review writers bought the S7 protector for the S7 edge is that there is a slight curve to the screen on the edges Its very subtle but it is there and I didnt even realize it until I put the glass protector on and it didnt sit flat at the edges I kept trying to push it down thinking I just didnt apply enough pressure at the edges but if you squeeze down harder on the edges itself then a bubble starts to form towards the middle As its the glass it cant bend to fit securely on the screen so once I put pressure on the edge it was forces to keep its form and come up in other places to achieve that state My photos show where the protector didnt seal against the screen along the edgewhere its sealed its black and where its gray is where its not sealed I am very disappointed with Zagg on this product because had they actually tested this on a unit they would have realized it wouldnt work and not sell it Seems like the just got the measurements of the phone and just created the screen protector for it Im going to return this to Best Buy and purchased the HD screen protectorof course after reading the reviews I see that Zagg is going to come out with a curved glass protector for both the new S7 phones but until then I will need something to protect the screen ,positive
The Zagg glass covering my regular Samsung S7 is terrific with one major drawback It seems that even my regular S7 has a slight curve in the screen on the long edges Therefore the last 18 or so of the sides of the Zagg glass cover are not really touching the screen If you dont have a case or if your case doesnt have tall enough sides to protect the screen you will find yourself touching those areas and inevitably making fingeredgeshaped breaks in the glass This can not be helped the glass is hanging there off the screen These breaks only extend as far as the raised part of the cover where it does not touch the screen but REALLY NOW This is not what I paid a premium price for I would have thought this issue would have played into the design of the cover I fear that ZAGG will be replacing this cover more than once over the phones lifetime ,negative
Not the best fit around the edges as others have stated The S7 non edge version does have a slight bend around the edge of the glass So the zaag glass screen protector does not fit well on the outside edge It looks like you didnt press the screen protector down or have an air bubble on the Edge but you dont The screen protector is constantly lifted just a little off the screen With a case on you dont notice it as much but if you try to drag icons to the Edge or use the edge of your phone it doesnt work until you press VERY hard I purchased the non edge screen protector for the Non edge s7 and it just doesnt live up to the zaaz quality you expect I gave it 1 star as it does protect the screen from damage but makes it hard to use The 2nd star is because of the added bonus of collecting all the lint in my pocket 2 photos are of the issue pen is not lifting the screen protector just showing where the Edge is and the lifted edge Case on the phone is the Spigen® Ultra Hybrid AIR CUSHION Crystal Clear ,positive
Even after being assured by Best Buy rep who was great BTW did look at these reviews with me that this thing would fit it doesnt Not even a week later dustdirt under both sides Contacted Zagg who is now putting one out that DOES cover the edges Zaggs reply was that this is SUPPOSED to fit like this That this protector is supposed to have a halo effect on around the edges and that all of their products have a lift Huh So then why not advertise this as such due to the S7 design inform your biggest retailer that the sides will NOT lay flat 700 phone I dont want some misfit piece of junk covering the screen And unfortunately this is all Best Buy has to offer if you want to leave the store with a protector on Zagg is indeed putting out a new one that promises to cover the sides of both S7 and S7 Edge I guess thats a coincidence And they are NOT going to exchange these defects that they claim are not defective They are offering an exchange for the exact same product So by that offer and their joke offer of free shipping we should be exchanging these weekly then Major fail on Zagg Major fail for not letting Best Buy reps know this product is supposed to not lay flat And major fail for not being willing to exchange them Stay far away from this mess Unless you want to be 48 out 3999 plus installation You work too hard for your money dont throw it away ,negative
I have always used recommended and even sold Zagg screen protectors as a wireless professional but I must admit these S7 Invisible Shield Glass suck Thinking it was an issue with the installation or possibly a defective product I emailed Zagg they sent me a replacement waived shipping costs and didnt require that I sent them the original shield back Well after a week and a half I got the new one after I powered it off and let it sit for 510 mins I obsessively cleaned my brand new S7 installed the new shield and let it sit overnight The next morning I awoke to find the same halo or ring around my screen where the adhesive didnt stick I emailed Zagg 3 times more asking if I paid the difference and upgraded to the Curved Glass Shield would it remedy my issue 10 days later and well outside my orig 30 im still awaiting an answer Is this really what they provide a customer for 4499 I put my otterbox on it and left it on untill I find a company who makes something suitable You made me sad Zagg Not cool all ,negative
I have used Zagg screen protectors for all my devices and if I need to replace my crack screen protector not a problem when I can just pay 5 for a replacement I believe that this is best screen protector on the market today The great thing about this protector and not just this protector from Zagg but all their screen protectors have a lifetime warranty After your purchase the screen protector the first thing you do is go to the Zagg website and register the screen protector because If your screen protector has happens to crack instead of having to buy a new one just login into the Zagg website and order a replacement screen for only 5 which covers shipping or shipping is free I dont remember They will send you a screen protector once you received in the mail go to best buy have them remove the old screen protector and put on the new screen protector Then you send old screen protector back to Zagg using the yellow envelope that they sent you in the mail Though you spend a lot of money for the best screen protector on the market and if it cracks order a replacement for 5 and send in the old one without having to buy a new one each time I recommend getting the Glass screen protector NOT the Plastic version I will say for the S7 screen protectors that there a some batches of the product out there that have not worked out the issue with fully protecting the screen with the short curve it has I still does the job because I have a case on my S7 you hardly notice it ,positive
Let me say that I love Samsung and the Galaxy phones as well as Zagg in the past I have had nothing but great experiences with both products and companies However the new phones specifically the Galaxy S7 has a beveled edge to the screen This means that the screen protector will NOT lay flat all the way to the edge The original salesperson gave me the line that the screen protector would blend to the edges over time It has been months and the edges are still off the glass And let me be clear the staff at Best Buy installed this product I have kept the screen protector on but this means that dirt gathers under the lip and it suffers from small frays and cracks I have no idea what Zagg would say if the glass broke probably something about it being my fault since the screen protector was frayed But it still provides protection for the phone I am just hoping that with all of the engineering minds at both companies they will come out with a screen protector that lays flat But as I am writing this the salesperson I recently spoke with says that it doesnt exist ,negative
I had Zagg glass piece on my S5 and then I threw my phone out of anger and it shattered the Zagg glass but kept my S5 screen intact I called Zagg n they sent me a replacement glass for my S5 So when I bought the S7 I decided to pay the 8 for the Best Buy employee to put it on The girl ruined the first one then the second attempt had a crack in it so it wouldnt seal right and the third time a piece of lint was trapped The fourth time was the charm or so I thought The edges look like they are still not sealed kind of looks like small bubbles and i keep trying to press it down and they disappear and come right back Its been over a month and I just havent had time to go back to Best Buy Its noticeable but not enough for me to go up there Well last week i was pushing on the edges as i often do and now its got a small crack that looks like how a window looks when a bullet goes through it There is also a chip on the edge that curves around the home button Now Im not happy especially since this was a 40 piece of glass Ive never had issues with Zagg glass until this one for my S7 It just seems like the quality isnt as good I hope they can replace it at store when I go this week Im going to give this one more try because Ive always considered these Zagg glass pieces to be a good investment to protect my phones expensive screen ,positive
I had a different brand screen protector from verizon store for 2 years on my HTC One M8 and it worked great I upgrade to the S7 and got the zagg screen prootector and it doesnt respond to my touch on one side of the screen unless i press down harder than normal Also if i run my finger along the side it wont start to recognize my touch until about a third of the way up the screen I tried returning it to Best Buy within 15 days and they refused to return or exchange it and instead directed me to the manufacturers website 3 weeks after purchase the screen chipped on the side and started to crack even though i never even dropped the phone or treated it roughly Apparently now i have to spend additonal funds for shipping to replace this fine product when it is a lifetime warranty Puts a bad taste in the mouth because of Best Buys return policy or should i say lack there of To top it off there is nothing on the receipt that explains their return policy Better yet the cell phone rep installs it immediately on the phone when its purchased which immediately cancels any chance of returning if you changed your mind ,negative
When I originally bought this product it was 40 Immediately after putting it on the screen protector did not adhere to my phone on the outside edges at all I have a regular Samsung Galaxy s7 not s7 edge and I made sure to buy the right screen protector But when I put it on my phone there is at least a centimeter or two on the entire outside edge that is lifted up and will not stick to the phone My friend had the same problem and even after ordering a replacement the replacement had the same exact issue as well Before ordering the replacement I had the original for two months and let me tell you there were cracks EVERYWHERE It would crack at the lightest drop bump scratch anything Honestly it cracked much easier than the phone itself ever would and while that should be a good thing it was just annoying Because the entire outer edge is lifted its super easy so get water or dust particles stuck underneath the screen protector Overall this purchase was a mistake Just stay with regular screen protectorsnot the glass ones Theyll save you a lot of money and frustration ,negative
Bought this screen protector for my Galaxy S7 and was not impressed with how it looked on my phone It did fit onto my screen but all around the edge of it it looks like it is lifted and has bubbles I got it put on at Best Buy and the employee who did it told me they all look that way due to the curves around the entire phone It drives me a little crazy but now I just ignore it I needed it more for protection for my screen I can say that it does have a year guarantee with Zagg if you register it and if something happens to it you pay a small replacement fee and theyll send you a new one Unfortunately I cracked this screen protector within a few days because I accidentally dropped it onto a cement floor It did save my actual screen though Thats what happens when you carry to many things at once Cracked the screen protector the first time it fell and still havent replaced it yet I am going to once I stop procrastinating Personally I dont think its worth the 40 because I was unhappy with the way it looked on my phone and unhappy that it broke the first time it fell It did save my actual screen so I still gave it 3 stars ,negative
I wanted to clear up the complaints about the edge of the screen protector having a haze or not making complete contact It is true however there is more to the story First the reason this is occurring is the new S7 design has a rounded corner along the edge not the S7 Edge the regular S7 This softens the edge Zagg failed to take this into account when they release the screen protector One option would have been to slightly shrink the size to match the flat surface and not extend over the curved portion of the screen That is the reason you have poor or no contact around the edge Is this important With your screen off black you can see it When the screen is on you can not see it Also if you have something like an Otter skin or Tech21 protector on your phone it hides it even more It is aggravating Zagg did not account for this but the safety and protection delivered by this glass screen protector is superior to anything else I have seen I had one on my S6 for the last year and it looks like the day I bought it Dont let the complaints about the edge discourage you Maybe Zagg will react quickly and release and updated version that addresses this ,negative
Someone at the store recommended this screen protector after it was installed I noticed it doesnt actually fit on the screen The Galaxy S7 not the edge still has a slight curvature on the sides That curvature means the glass doesnt fit flush and dust and dirt can and will get stuck under the screen You also end up looking at a piece of glass that is clearly not attached to the screen The gap between screen and glass around the edges also makes it hard to press buttons around the edge I would not recommend this unless they fix the gapping issue As it stands Im curious when the dust and dirt build up under the edges is going to drive me crazy and force me to go with a different protector In the attached picture you can see the gap around the edges ,negative
There are those people who needed a screen protector because they will drop their phone guaranteed I however am not one of those people I havent used Screen protector in years because other than usual wear and tear my screens typically look pretty dang good by the time I get a new phone For some reason they convinced me this time I got the case They installed it Looked perfect I was pretty pleaseduntil 6 days later it chipped and was dropping teeny tiny pieces of glass everywhere Then less than 24 hours later a large chunk of the corner chipped and made a crack So I took it back and they replaced it for free bc of the short time They gave me specific instructions for care the first 48 hours which they failed to include the first so I figured this time would be different I followed the instructions really well It was a weekend so I barely even touched my phone And here I am 6 days later 2 of those days the phone was unused and I have a chip a decent sized chip When I pay 40 for a screen protector it is expected to last Extremely disappointed in the product will never use it again ,positive
I bought two phones at Best Buy and had the protecters installed on both phones My phone is ok But my wifes is lifting around the edges Same phones same protectors She went back to Best Buy to see if they could fix the problem Their response was go to Zagg website and register it or Ill sell you a new one that fits the S7 properly Or Zagg will send you a new one for a cost of 500 They wouldnt make good on it because she went back after 14 days We purchased the items May 14th 2016 She went in on June 27 th because we had been out of town We were not aware of the Zagg warranty because they Best Buy employees threw away the screenprotector and phone case packaging away After they put the protector and case on The principal of the matter is if they put the wrong protector on whey should we have to pay the 5 dollars for the replacement or pay for a new one I feel it is their response ability to put the right products on your devices in the first place Still havent registered it yet Because of the principal behind the matter I have had this brand of protector on past phones with no issues what so ever I ,negative
I gave 5 stars because the product itself is great in my opinion I love zagg glass screen protectors but this one is not the right fit for the Galaxy S7 due to the slight curve on the sides of the phone The shield stays uplifted on the sides which caused the shield to crack on the bottom right edge of the screen protector being that it does not lay flat on the phone screen It was installed at Best Buy at the time of purchase I will definitely continue to buy zagg glass screen protectors again for my other products but not for this phone unless the protector is slightly curved like the phone I would recommend this product but not for this phone ,positive
Having recent moved from a Blackberry Z10 to the Samsung S7 I needed some sort of screen protector for the S7 From talking with others it was a toss up between the Zagg Glass or HD screen protector I went with the glass screen protector as the conversion always seemed to come back to it is better to break the glass on the screen protector than the actual screen Well as the S7 does not have a protected edge and I initially was using my S7 without a case and storing the S7 in my belt clip holster after a few slides across my car seats and down between the car seat rail and the floor the edges of the glass screen protector did exactly what they were suppose to do they chipped on the egdes Of course in an area where your fingers are normally when you are holding the phone For now I have added an OtterBox Commuter case to the phone and nave stopped using my holster This keeps my fingers from picking up little glass fragments however it means that my phone is in my back pocket on my desk or sitting on the table I will be replacing the glass InvisibleShield with an HD InvisibleShield soon ,negative
Zagg should have been prepared to deal with the S7s screen edges I am pretty disappointed in how the left and right edges of the screen protector are not in contact with the screen This causes the p and other far left or right items to be a pain to register In writing this is had to tap multiple times on the p to get it to register It requires more of a press than a tap Ive heard rumors that Zagg is fixing this issue in the next few months The raised edges have also presented a weak point in the strength of the screen protector The top and bottom corners in one side began to crack even though I have my phone in an otterbox slimIn the end however I would still recommend as currently there is not much better of an option and Zagg is supposed to fix it soon Im expecting an unconditional swap once the new ones are available Note to Zagg you should pay for the Geek Squad installation as Ive already paid and continue to deal with issues from your product ,positive
This is one of the worst products Ive ever purchased I had TMobile put it on since best buy charges a fee to apply it lame The guy who put it on said he didnt care for these particular ones and when I asked why his reply was oh you will find out soon enough well low n behold I did The edges of the screen protector wouldnt completely adhere to the phone screen It was like a bubble or something all the way around on the edges of it and within approximately 68 hours later there was already a couple cracks on the edges By the next day there was quite a few more I have only had it on my phone for a week and it looks like its been on for 6 months Needless to say it was a waste of 40 Doesnt really matter to me that its a lifetime warranty cause its pointless since I would have to send it in for a new one every other day I would give it 0 stars if I could ,negative
If you can get it on the phone right and I mean if this is an excellent screen protector The nicest thing about it is it is actually made of glass so you preserve the feel of the face of the phone and its very friendly to the touch The downside is you have to be extremely careful putting it on you pretty much have one chance If you get a single Speck of dust under this thing or if it goes on slightly crooked or anything like that youre going to have a bubble and its going to drive you insane until you buy the next one They do have a warranty and they better for 50 bucks You have to send it in to get the exchange though I much prefer the store brand if its available I bought this one that particular day because they were out of stock The store brand screen protector which I believe is by Insignia it has plenty of cleaning materials and also it has a plastic guide to Aid in installation Ive done two of them on my other phone and they work perfectly every time and theyre half the price ,positive
I wanted a tempered glass shield for my tobeshipped S7 this was the only S7 screen shield my local store hadWhen my S7 arrived I applied this shield My S7 was brand spanking new But the bottom part of this shield didnt stickI was passing by a Best Buy Mobile store figured they would have more choices wrong and stopped in they were closing early what the heck and the people there said they wouldnt exchange the shield because it had been more than 15 days I think they just wanted to go home Gee whiz I couldnt apply the shield until the new S7 arrived in the mailSo I made a special trip back to the same Best Buy where I bought the shield and exchanged it for a new one Ill try reapplying it soon Hope it worksI did not have this much trouble with a generic tempered glass shield I bought from e bay for my S5Very disappointed that all the Best Buy stores dont treat customers the same way ,negative
I dont know why people hate this so much Its probably because they didnt have the Best Buy guy put this on for them If its done properly this stuff is great Ive put this on several of my phones and have it for my parents phones and its good stuff In case you are clumsy and drop your phone at least this will crack first not your glass on your phone You can spend 35 on this stuff or pay 100 to replace the glass on your phone and hope it works the same It will make your phone a bit heavier too but it will keep your phone safe especially if you have kids who break their phones all the time Plus it helps keep your phone cleaner too its easy to clean and keeps your phone germ free Have the Best Buy people put this on for you they are the experts and will make sure its done right Dont do it yourself thats why you guys all hate it and think it sucks And you got ta let it chill for a day or two you cant picking at it or messing with it right away ,positive
The issue of this screen protector not fitting the Galaxy S7 has been well documented in reviews so I will not reiterate the issue Zagg messed up on this one and should have recalled this product long ago especially for the price Zaggs website no longer list this product for the S7 as they now have a curved Glass protector for the S7 and S7 Edge I called Zagg and they will replace this screen protector for the new curved one but there is currently one issue with the new one The new curved Glass protector only comes in opaque black The screen is obviously clear but the portion that covers the color portion of the face is opaque so your gold platinum or other color phone is covered and will have a black face FYI BB does not carry the new curved Zagg product To be fair the old product will work and protect your screen if you do not mind the halo effect Zagg should lower the price of this product considerably to compensate ,positive
This screen protector isnt perfect but it really isnt the fault of the protector Samsungs decision to slightly curve the sides of the S7s screen makes finding a good glass screen protector difficult Ive owned 2 protectors that seal to the screen fully BUT they didnt cover the whole viewing screen and left annoying edges on the on the touch screen The Zagg protector covers the entire viewing screen but does not seal to it completely because of the curves The edges of the screen are responsive more protected and I dont notice the edges not being fully sealed It also fits well with a Speck case or an Otter DefenderZagg does now make a curved protector but it is considerably more expensive and some reviewers say it is tough to put a case on with the curved protector installed As long as I own an S7 this Zagg is my choice ,positive
I purchased this glass screen protector knowing full well what the reviews were on it But I felt I did not have a choice as you never know what will happen to your phone Overall it does the job but there are 2 significant issues you should be aware of that are frustrating at times but in my opinion should not prevent you from buying the product Issue 1 is that you WILL get a halo effect around the edge of the display as the Galaxy S7s screen is slightly curved Along with this halo effect the screen protector can get a little dirty around the edge but it has been very minor for me The second issue and maybe the bigger problem of the 2 is that the touch screen sensitivity is made less in certain areas which can drive you crazy at times Sliding down notifications from the top or pressing any button around the edge typically requires y a harder press This being said it is probably still the best option for protecting your S7 ,negative
This screen protector has a great feel and does an awesome job at resisting oilsmudges The only problem is that it does not fit the slightly beveled edge of the Galaxy S7 nonEdge The result is a halo effect a quick online search will show this is a universal problem due to a design flaw around the edge of the phone which attracts dirt and lint under it almost immediately I would recommend finding a more temporary perhaps nonglass version until Zagg updates their design to accommodate the edges of this phoneAnd remember Best Buy at least in Woodbridge VA will charge you about 8 to install one of these screen protectors even if you purchase the brand new phone from them complain about the fitment of the protector before you leave and get told to just bring it back and well replace it if the fit doesnt resolve itself after a couple days ,negative
I purchased the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and like all my other smart phones i have had i want screen protection I purchased the Zagg Glass Screen Protector because of Zaggs quality and reputation I had Best Buy install this on my phone cause i am not to good at this sort of thing He warned me that with this Glass Screen Protector there was going to be a Halo around the edge of the screen cause the Samsung Galaxy S7 screen is curved at the edge I thought this was ok What i did not anticipate was under the glass where the halo is its a dust magnet Pocket lint and dust gets under the glass and looks bad I am unsure what to do about it cause i still want screen protection but the dust under the halo is so annoying I hope zagg comes out with a new and improved product cause i will probably just take this off soon and go with out Also this screen protector is EXPENSIVE not worth the price when it has a halo that collects dirt ,negative
My husband and I both purchased these for our new Samsung S7 phones not edge Mine cracked in the corner just being in my purse I believe something got underneath the edge that doesnt stick to the screen and caused the crack My husband dropped his phone and all around the edges was cracked We ordered warranty replacements and Zagg only sent us plastic protectors not the glass When I asked about this obvious problem with the glass the rep said they are aware of the problem and are waiting for a new design to become available Were still waiting In the meantime Zagg is harassing me to send back my broken glass screen protector or they are going to charge me full retail for the replacements they sent us I dont have a lot of trust in this companys design or warranty process These certainly were no where near worth the money spent or all the hype ,negative
Center of screen area is great and seems to proctect well from scratches etc however with the slightly contoured edges of the s7 the flat screen protector leaves a ring around the outside of the phone screen where it is not actually attached to the screen this gap allows for dust and the like to get under the screen protector edges which I find frustrating as I try to keep my phone screen clean I have had it on my phone for about two weeks I am gentle with my phone in daily use and there are already two cracks in the screen protector only at the edges where the screen protector does not actually seal to the phone while its understandable that free floating glass would be fragile it is still annoying to see every day on my phone and I think if the screen protector actually sealed to the screen all the way around this probably would not have happened ,positive
I purchased this screen protector for my Galaxy S7 because I was very happy with the one I had on my Galaxy Note 4I love the fact that the glass shield actually feels like the phone itself and yet offers excellent protection at the same timeIve only been using this protector for 3 months luckily no drops to test its capabilities but I have no doubts that this will work as well as the one I had for the Note 4Zagg is very easy to work with both registering the product and getting a replacement when neededOf special note to me anyways I had to replace my phone within a week of purchasing it and putting on the Zagg Shield and I was able to remove the shield and reapply it to the new phone without a hitchThis is easily the best investment for protecting my phone that I could have ,positive
Ive owned other Zagg Glass screen protectors that have worked out very well but this one seems to be lesser quality The shield doesnt cover the phone all the way to its edges The edges dont adhere because of the slightly curved phone edges Within two days of application the screen protector was already cracked in the corner Ordered a warranty replacement and within a few days of application of that one there was a big scratch across the face of it I keep the phone in my purse and have never had issues with other Zagg products Ive had this phone for about a month and already had two screen protectors replaced Ordering warranty replacements add up when you have to keep paying for shipping ,negative
Have use Zagg products in the past for different phonesThe S7 NON EDGE Model still has a very slight curve on the sides of the displayThe glass protector is flat and therefore leaves the smallest of gaps around the edges of the phoneThis gap will cause the protective layer to crack as I experienced when I dropped the phone and the glass protector cracked at the bottom right exactly where the gap between the protection layer and screen exist Supposedly Zagg recognizes this gap and is updating the product to fit flush in future product releasesIve removed the cracked screen protector completely and have gone with the Lifeproof FRE case Save yourself 40 and find a solid case or a correctly formed screen protector ,positive
Purchased this because I was told it was the best screen protector Paid the tech at the store to put it on and within 4 days it lifted from the corner Was told I had to contact Zagg to get a replacement and will then have to pay again to have it placed on the phone My hand shakes so its not best for me to do it Inconvenient for sure I have to answer whether or not I would recommend this and can only pick yes or no My answer is truthfully I dont know that option is not available And I havent dropped the phone thankfully If I do before the replacement arrives and my screen cracks I will be extremely unhappy ,positive
Weve used Zagg shields in the past and loved them Had them on our wife and I S5s and they saved us once each And easy replacement from Zagg customer service is without reproach This particular shield isnt perfect though Right at the edge of the screen it doesnt stay stuck down The S7 has a slight fall off near the edge that isnt flat You can see the shield doesnt make contact around that border and requires a little harder tap if theres something right near the edge of the screen Its about 18 on either sideI still think this is probably the best product on the market for the phone The soft shields are horrible Even the Zagg soft one comes too close to the edges it was an exact perfect fit and precludes the use of a cover that comes up over the edge ,positive
This is just a patch that ZAGG released early as a way to get people to buy a screen protector they know doesnt fit ZAGG support says a contoured one will release beginning of April so wait until then to get one Best Buy should put out a notice in the meantime that you are purchasing a faulty product Should just buy a case with a screen shield until then unless you dont mind dust collectors and scratching yourself on the screen protector ,negative
Zagg just announced that the curved version of this protector is now available I recommend purchasing that protector insteadYes even the nonEdge version of the S7 has a slight curve at the L R edges And since this protector is flat it separates from the screen at the edges The Best Buy associate used the euphemism of it being a halo effect but did not tell me about this feature until after I purchased it and had them install it If it were only cosmetic it would not bother me that much However realize that where the protector does not touch the screen the touch screen will obviously be inoperative So things like dragging icons from one home screen to the next is difficult unless you press down hard when doing so ,negative
My wife and I recently bought Galaxy S7 phones We bought the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector at the same time and had them installed in the store Zagg produced an original glass screen protector which was flat Subsequently after the release of the S7 phone Zagg produced a protector that has curved edges to match the screen of the S7 When using the flat screen protector on an S7 the edges of the protector tend to chip and split because the edges of the protector do not curve with the screen Buying the protector at the time of purchasing the phone the sales associate put on a flat protector Why The problem with the flat screen is a know problem I will eventually have to have the screen protector replaced with one that s curved I just dont get why they installed the problem protector ,negative
Best Buy had only one brand in stock for my my Samsung Galaxy s7 phone It smudges leaves your fingerprints hard to clean its not clear looks dirty when its actually clean It doesnt stick properly there are alot of air bubbles I personally think is not worth it especially for the price I would not buy this productbrand again nor would I recommend it The one I had prior worked better was cheaper and didnt smudge and was very clear Also there were no air bubbles It lasted a long time I am going to return it Supposedly this brand has a long warranty which I have to double check Its kinda hard to know whether or not its going to work because its a one shot try and deal ,positive
Ive used these products before from this company but find them to be a little bit expensive it doesnt quite cover the screen appropriate age of the bend in the glass on a Galaxy S7 I found that to be the first place that it cracked when I dropped it I need to send it back to the company to see if they truly will replace it heard that they will and I also heard that they have a new product that will cover the screen little bit better will be about 5 more Im hoping they will replace it with just a newer version however I found other brands and different stores that cost a little bit less actually about half the price sticker glass and covers the screen better not sure if the warranty on the glass to be a forever warranty is worth the price or not yet I would still recommend this product to a friend ,positive
We purchased another Zagg Glass after the original one was not meant for our Galaxy 7 We inadvertently purchased the Glass for the Galaxy 7 Edge This new Glass was sent to us by Zagg and it still really doesnt fit the screen well We followed the installation instructions exactly and the Glass is coming away from the screen at the long side of the phone Both my husband and I have the Galaxy 7 and this is happening to both our phones My husbands Glass has already cracked at one of the sides that isnt adhering Neither the crack nor the sides not sticking to the screen is affecting the overall performance of the phone so we will probably just keep these Our prior phone was a Galaxy 5 with Zagg Glass and we had no issues whatsoever ,negative
I grant you that my review on this item is more a reflection of bad design on Samsungs end rather than a poorly made product on Zaggs side The slightly rounded edge around the outside of the screen makes any kind of screen protector not want to stick very well and this poor adhesion in my experience with four or five of both the HD glass series and the regular HD Zagg Shields creates air pockets where the screen protectors just peel up over time and then pop off completely when you try to stick your phone in your pocket Theyre a pain Dont get me wrong I absolutely love Zagg products They are excellent But on these phones both the S7 and the S7 edgenote they are functionally poor Its better just to buy a cheap doublesided phone protector elsewhere ,negative
installation of the screen protector was easy and worked perfectly until it got to the last 18 of the outside edge of the phone No matter how hard I pressed the adhesive would not stick down I even put books and weights on top of it but it still didnt work Now the edges are open for dust and dirt to get underneath the screen protector and completely ruins the purpose of having one Now I not only have to figure out a way to remove the screen protector I also have to purchase a new oneBecause it has a lifetime guarantee I can get a new one for free just pay additional shipping and handling but Im worried it will do the exact same thing I will not purchase this brand of screen protector in the future ,positive
I bought this 2 days ago and i was so excited being that it seemed to be a great product Not today i noticed that the sides didnt lay down flush with the phone screen because the screen has a slight curve to the edgesi own the regular S7 not the edge Now because the side werent flush with the phone the screen protector shattered Ether i am going to have to see if best buy will replace with out the box or wait for zagg to do it and pay at lease 4 more and be right back where i started with a bad design screen protector Total waste of 40 never buying Zag again should have stayed with Ghost Armor ,positive
I usually get the high grade self healing film for my phone It was not in stock at the store and so this screen protector was recommended by the sales person They put it on my phone before I left and told me the halo around the edge would disappear It was still there a week later I received my case a week later and put the case on The corner caught on the case and shattered NOT GOODI did call the store to complain and was directed to come in for a different screen protector as I did NOT want the same item replacement from the manufacturer When the new screen protector arrived the store did apply it for me and now Im very happy with my new film screen protector I will not get the glass type screen protector ever again ,positive
I purchased my tempered glass screen protector about two months ago When I went home and applied the screen protector to my phone I was disappointed with the finished product because the edges of the tempered glass would not adhere to the edges of my screen So I took my phone with the tempered glass back to Best Buy That is when I found out that a Best Buy professional would have applied the screen protector for me to ensure that it was applied correctly This is when they also informed me that it would take some time for the edges of the screen protector to adhere to the screen Two months later and the edges of the screen protector still have not adhered to my phone screen and now the tempered glass has also cracked ,negative
This is the first ZAgg tempered glass protector I have bought and I didnt read the reivews first or I would have passed The s7 screen slightly rolls back on the sides so the tempered glass doesnt lay against the sides it just floats above the screen This may be why folks are breaking the things when pulling or retrieving from purses or pockets The edges snag and crack or chip the tempered glass I use a tech21 glass that fits snug around the edges so the edges arent out there to snag on stuff so mine hsnt been a problem The screen saver doesnt effect the high quality of the screen image like the ones I have used in the past so thats a plus Even if they make these things curved how would you get it to line up I cant recommend it though until they update the curve issue ,negative
I went into the Best Buy Mobile store that is located in the mall since the main store would not put this on my phone and allowed the manager there to do it He messed up on it when he put it on and Im glad he did I see what everyone is complaining about On the screen not the part around the screen that is the color of the phone about a millimeter from the edge the glass cover is not mesh with the screen I played with my phone a little bit to see if it would bother me and it did so the manager removed it and had to write it off I hope they redo this screen I have seen them on other phones and tablets as well and they are mesh with the entire face of the phone and look nice I would recommend it if they make it fit correctly like it does on the iphone and tablets ,positive
I purchased this product after such great experience in the past with zagg glass shield I knew at the time of purchase that it doesnt quite fit exact After reading several reviewsIt is noted on the Galaxy S7 the screen has just a slight curve on the edge This is not the S7 edge just the base S7 model However the Glass Shield does not have the small curve to it This leaves a slight halo effect on the sides of the screen The sales person at best buy kept saying this will go away after a few days This has not changed However I did not expect it to change After reading information on the Zagg website I found they are reworking the product and will be putting out a different model in the future that does curve slightly on the edge ,positive
I replaced my Edge with regular S7 and assumed that the glass protector would fit well if I had a flat screen however the regular S7s screen is not completely flat either although it is obviously moreso than the Edge and so the glass protector does not seal fully on both the right and left sides Ive had the protector on for about a week and already have MULTIPLE cracks and breaks in the screen protector I will not bother having it replaced as it does not fit well in the first place I looked online after it was clearly too late at this point to see if there was a trick to fix it and found that lots of people had similar problems with no solution Save your time and money and avoid the glass protector ,negative
The Zagg screen saver feels just like the unprotected screen on my Samsung S7 Note I have it on the S7 not the edge The screen saver went on easily but I think the edges of the S7 not edge are slightly curved down and the screen saver does not make full contact with the edges About 18 of an inch on both sides are light gray I can press the screen saver down on the edges but it pulls right back up It has not caused any functional problems using the phone just looks odd ,positive
My fiancé and I both preordered the S7 I got the Edge When we picked them up he got a case screen protector We didnt want to pay 5 for an associate to apply it so we took care of that at home I can not believe how ill fitted it is The edge on both sides does not fit due to the curve of the phone so the entire screen is not protected His screen protector cracked on the edge within 3 days of purchase after he dropped it in the bathroom Im so happy to see that Zagg is redesigning them to fit the S7 but I know we wont be able to swap the ill fitted one for it What a waste of 40 It shouldnt have ever been released if it didnt fit properly Wait for the remake DO NOT BUY THIS ONE ,negative
I bought this while I was in the store when a woman came in wanting a new phone because her screen was literally Destroyed It looked like it was shot with a bullet The geek squad tech took a look at it and realized she had a ZAGG Screen Protector He removed it and her phone was in PERFECT CONDITION She was Amazed the tech was amazed he even said her phone should be the poster child for the ZAGG Protector I was Amazed and Bought one on the Spot And she did not have replacement insurance She was So Happy and Satisfied ,positive
Definite addon We put this on my wifes phone since she doesnt have the best track record with phones and we are very glad we did Two weeks after putting it on her phone she was buckling herself into the car and she hit the screen of her phone glancingly with the buckle There was a spiderweb crack that appeared on the screen where she hit it Upon further inspection it turns out that the screen protector did its job and absorbed all the damage We filed a claim with Zagg and got the new screen protector in about 4 days We took the new screen protector and phone down to our local BB and they happily installed the new one free of chargeWell worth the investment ,positive
The Best Buy sales associate recommended that I purchase this Zagg screen protector for my new S7 phone You cant even tell you have it on the phone I was able to tap and use all of the selections on my phone easily Very smooth and clear Within 3 weeks of having my new phone and this screen protector I noticed a deep chip on the screen protector and was fearful that it went all the way down through to my phones screen But this Zagg protector did exactly what it was supposed to do It took the hit and saved my phone screen Then Zagg replaced the chipped protector like they guarantee All in all Best Buy and Zagg and this product were great ,positive
I was very disappointed with the screen protector I had Geek Squad put it on they had told me after then put it on to wait 24 to 48 hours to put the phone back into a case I proceeded have waited at least a week tried to put the phone in the case and started filling up the edges and make bubbles screen protector I do not recommend anybody getting this type of screen protector if youre going to be putting it into a case I just wasted 35 bucks for a screen protector that absolutely did nothing and I will not recommend this to anyone Im sorry to be the bearer of bad news but I think thats why I shouldnt make this right with me give me some line of credit but I will not buy a screen protector from them again ,negative
This was a very pricey screen protector and I expected it to last with my minimal phone usage and protective care It cracked within a month This protector when applied to the galaxy 7 leaves a significant gap between the edge of the screen protector and the phone case This is where my crack originated having hit something lightly just on the edge of the screen protector This product does come with a lifetime warranty I believe and they will replace the protector which requires the cracked one be sent to them As the crack does not yet bother me to use my phone I have not yet attempted to submit a claim Hopefully I am not replacing this screen protector regularly only time will tell ,negative
I bought this one to replace the one I purchased a year and a half ago Its glass so it will crack but it totally protects your screen If you get a chip in it you will feel it when you rub your finger across it but you dont feel the cracks Easy to install and bubbles are easily removed The only thing I dont like about it is it doesnt seem to adhere on the edges Theres a small ring less than a quarter inch wide around the outside of the protector that I cant seem to get to stick to the phone Maybe this is by design so you can easily remove it ,negative
I purchased two of these screen protectors one for an S7 black and another for an S7 gold Surprisingly the screen protector did not fully adhere to the black S7 and had a visible halo on the edges where the protector could not stick due to a very slight curve of the screen edges The gold S7 did not have this problem and the protector worked fine sticking completely without the halo If you run into this issue Zagg upgraded me to the Glass curve protector through their warranty program which worked on the black S7 Not sure why they havent fully addressed this Never had a problem with a Zagg product before Just be aware of your model before buying ,positive
I had the salesperson install this when setting up the S7 and it wasnt his 1st installation but even though this is not the S7 edge the cover never laid down to the edges It left a 18 inch wide gray line all the way around the screen Great for catching pocket lint I thought You could press it down but it would come back up instantly The case was not on it so it wasnt the case I gave up until the next morning and tried again and it started chipping and cracking on the edges this will be my 1st and last glass cover Going to back to get the non glass HD like I had on my S5 and hope that works and hope to get my money back on this one ,positive
I had to get this replaced a few months after purchase due to it breakingtearingcracking It cut my finger when I tried to use my phone Best buy replaced it and reinstalled the new one It worked good again for a few months then started to lift in the upper corner then cracked on one side then cracked again below the first crack The cracks are small enough and close enough to the edge they havent cut my finger yet I will have to replace soon though Im sure I had a better one on my last phone but cant remember what the name of it was ,positive
My husband is on his third Zagg screen protector He keeps dropping his phone and he is very glad he purchased this particular screen protector We like Zagg because unlike others you are not required to return the item to receive the replacement The first time his protector broke they had one in stock at our Best Buy store and he was able to replace it on the spot The second time the store was out of stock so they ordered one which came within two business days of ordering Very good customer service ,positive
We have always used Zagg protectors First I tried the Zagg curved glass protector Not sure if we had a defective one but the protector didnt seem to adhere to the screen except around the very edge After a week I put a Otterbox Symmetry case on the phone and Zagg curve glass protector popped off When touching the center of the protector there was no adhesive to the touch except around the edges Then I got the standard non curved Zagg It works better with the Otterbox Symmetry case The one negative for this product is the glass on the S7 has a slight curve The Zagg doesnt contour to this curve So you get a halo around the protector which dustdirt gets under ,negative
This screen cover is a joke especially at 40 heck I wouldnt recommend it if it was 1 I decided to splurge on it in store wof looking up reviews because I thought zagg was supposed to make the best tempered glass protectors As others have mentioned the sides do not adhere at all due to mild curves of the screen I was meticulous putting this on my 1 day old phone and I can guarantee it wasnt my fault Luckily best buy gave me a refund but these are a total scam and seriously need to be taken off the shelves ,positive
So i was told about this by one of the Bestbuy phone people and after hearing him put about how great it was i gave it a try the first problem i have with it was fit the edges of the protector dont fit flush with my phone and are a little lifted and would catch things if the phone was not in a case and are a bit sharp As for the protection it does not get scratched up like the plastic ones would or mine has not yet The last thing is some how the protector has cracked on one of the edges even tho the phone is in an otterbox i feel this happend due to the edge not being fully attached to the phone Even with the minor things i have problems with i would still get another ,negative
Ive always been a great supporter of the Zagg Glass shields This was the one time where I was only a little disappointed but the curved edges of the phone didnt help that So its not entirely the screens fault However the first day I accidentally dropped it the protector chipped in a couple spots Definitely a bummer Ive only had the phone with protector for 4 months and the wear is definitely noticeable after only a handful of drops a couple cracks 3 chips and one corner that no longer sticks down Nevertheless it has held up well The lifetime warranty is always worth it and Ill probably get a new protector through that soon ,positive
I gave 5 stars because the product itself is great in my opinion I love zagg glass screen protectors but this one is not the right fit for the Galaxy S7 due to the slight curve on the sides of the phone The shield stays uplifted on the sides which caused the shield to crack on the bottom right edge of the screen protector being that it does not lay flat on the phone screen It was installed at Best Buy at the time of purchase I will definitely continue to buy zagg glass screen protectors again for my other products but not for this phone unless the protector is slightly curved like the phone I would recommend this product but not for this phone ,positive
The clarity and smoothness are fantastic in the VERY middle of the screen but they didnt account for the curved edges of the phone even the standard Galaxy S7 has a fairly substantial curve This means the side edges of the screen protector DO NOT sit on the screen correctly and leaves a halo on both sides of the phone where the glass doesnt meet the screen which causes constant problems with touch screen functionality and looks ungodly Do not buy this ,positive
In less than a month I have used the warranty to replace a cracked screen protector and I already have cracks in the replacement I am a HUGE fan of the tempered glass screen protectors but have not had much luck with this one I previously had a Zagg tempered glass protector and I managed to go almost 2 years without cracks etc I dont feel that I have dropped my phone anymore than usual so Im not sure why I am having more problems Also it doesnt seem to seal completely around the edge there is 18 border that starts to look gross after a month I give the company props for offering a warranty though glass is much better looking than the film protectors ,negative
Only 3 compliments with 3 complaints 1Clear it makes your phone looks new2 Left no fingerprints or dirty marks on the center side of cover3 Its another glass on the glass so it might protect the screen very well if accident happensWhy minus the stars1 The size did not cover the whole actual screen2 Every edges of this protector didnt stick to the actual phones screen very well maybe because this product is too thick3 Because of the reason above it leaves room for dust or dirt to stay on the edges of my phone screen ,negative
Bought this as my 7th ZAGG screen protector and I am very dissappointed to say its a bad product that does NOT fit the Samsung Galaxy S7 device When I contacted ZAGG today after purchasing last night and discovering it did not fit properly they acknowledged that the products do not fit and while they are working on a Glass Curve that does fit it will not be out until 2017 They offered me the alternative replacement of the glass which I know from reviews doesnt fit or the HD Clear They can only replace and not refund products purchased from 3rd party sellers DO NOT BUY So sad to say they just lost a lifetime customer ,negative
See My review Feb 26 This product does not fit the Galaxy S7 not edge It is functional and will protect but leaves an one eighth halo on the outer edges where it can not adhere to the screen due to the slight curve of the screen on the standard S7 After one month of use I have not had the problem others have had with dirtlint collecting under the screen edges The new Zagg Glass Curve for the S7 is now available from Zagg However it still is not all clear The top and bottom are black opaque and will cover the color of your phone Until they offer an all clear Glass Curve I will continue to use this unit ,positive
Although this is designed for the Galaxy S7 it does not fit The S7 has a slight curve around the edge and this protector does not take that into consideration Best Buy unsuccessfully tried installing this three times before advising it is not designed properly to fit this phone If installed you will see a halo affect 18 14 around the whole phone This halo easily chips and cracks The sales rep advised Best Buy shouldve removed these from the shelves she removed the ones at this store Zagg is also aware this does not fit the phone properly and have come out with a curved edge version for this S7 ,negative
Got this shield 30 dais ago because of the clarity It is very clear and easy to clean But doesnt fit the S7 very well and there is a halo around the edge where it wont smooth down My husband dropped his phone 2 foot onto a rubber mat and it hit the corner pushing the cover against the halo edge which caused the glass to splinter Would suggest getting one that is a better fit or not glass Picture shows splinter and halo around edges Thankfully Zaggcom has a lifetime warranty ,positive
Like the previous reviews state it doesnt lay flat at the edges of the screen and I have the S7 When I was in Best Buy I asked the rep if the protector would go to the edge of the screen because my Otterbox one didnt and I asked if it was because the curve at the edges of the screen He said it would fit no problem but it doesnt I went to Invisible Shields website and saw they are coming out with the glass protector that will go with the curve for the S7 and Edge I added myself to the waiting list but I already threw out the packaging and the receipt for the one I have now so I think Im SOS ,negative
What can I say about zaggit truly is the best I use it for all of my devices and can not begin to explain the amount of money it has saved me Initial cost of 40 will tend to push some people away for a cheaper screen protector please resist this urge Ive literally shut my phone in between my car door and the body of my car with no breakage Once the zagg has crackedbroken just peel it off and send back for a FREE Warranty replacement Its that simple Purchase for almost any phone and computer screen It bets paying 100 ir more to get something fixed Trust me youll make your money back in no time ,positive
Ive been a long time user of Zagg Products and this one just dissapoints Ive had it fitted since I first got the S7 and already has a hairline crack across the screen and 2 pin point cracks at the edges of the screen Ive had Zagg glass fitted on my Apple ipod 5th gen with similar problems and had it for a while before I had problems Ive also had privacy glass fitted on my S5 with no problems at all First when applying it the left and right edges dont completely stick And now I have a couple cracks I havent had it for long and pretty disappointing it has only been a couple weeks ,negative
its rare that I am unhappy with something I was recommended to buy at your store but here you go it just happenedI just bought and it literally broke on installationits supposed to be a glass quality screen and WHILE I was applying it because the edge of the screen would not contact with the screen and I GENTLY pressed as recommended it shatteredof course I am going to ask for a lifetime warranty replacement from Zagg but I will have to pay for shipping this product is clearly a piece of junk ,negative
I have a reputation for cracking my screens quite horribly I am a bit clumsy with my phones With my most recent phone i decided to take a little more caution Id researched different screen protectors offered by best buy This was what I thought to be the best Ive had a few tumbles and the screen is still in great shape almost a month after purchasing the protector In fact i cracked the protector a tiny bit but it did its job the actual screen was safe My only negative about the product is that the edging of the protector doesnt go all the way to the out edge of the phone ,positive
I originally bought this protector on sale it was a nice deal since I figured it would be better than a plastic one for about the same price But I have to say Im disappointed The glass was pealing up at the slightly curved edges of the phone so dirt and dust could get under it I was also worried about it cracking there Ive never had a glass screen protector before so Im not sure if it was a problem I had or just a feature of glass ones but I found that I really had to press on the screen a lot to get the touch screen work I registered the warranty on the Zagg website but honestly I wont be replacing it ,negative
First things first these screen protectors are fantastic With thay being said this particular screen protector DOES NOT fit the S7 screen The screen of the S7 has a very slight but noticeable curve at the edges This screen protector lies flat and does not curve with the screen leaving a halo effect on the sides Over time dust and debris builds up underneath Zagg is currently working on developing a better screen protector for this phone Buy a cheaper one until that one is releasedTLDRIt doesnt fit the phone Buy a cheap protector until Zagg releases the new version ,negative
I paid 50 each for 3 Zagg HD Glass Screen Protectors for my 2 new Samsung Galaxy S7s and S6 phones ALL 3 of them cracked within 34 weeks of purchase Bestbuy covers 14 days so I had to deal with Zagg for the lifetime warranty Each time it took several weeks to get the replacement and they sent me the wrong model and also sent me the dry protectors instead of the glass This is the 3rd time I am waiting for them to send me the CORRECT replacements and I have only had the phones since 4816 Ive had cheap 5 protectors that have lasted the lifetime of the phones that were far superior to Zaggs in my opinion ,negative
Disappointed that this glass Shield cracked after two days However the sales associate at Best Buy put it on and told me that there are sometimes problems with this on the Galaxy S7 but never expected it to crack in 2 days Went online to Zagg to register and then also request a replacement and saw that Best Buy was 5 more then buying directly from Zagg Going in to the Best Buy store and hoping they will make this right by refunding me 5 as well as giving me a replacement so I dont have to go through warranty and wait a week to get a new one online ,negative
I got my phone early through a preorder from tmobile I was surprised to see this on the shelf so I bought it It fits poorly as the protection is flat and the Galaxy S7 has slightly curved edges around the glass I do not own the S7 Edge This makes it difficult to use the screen and keyboard sometimes as the borders of the glass stay somewhat elevated once applied This product should be recalled ,negative
This glass protector is a mess It doesnt lay flat on the screen so there is a lifted area around the edge of the whole phone which wouldnt be an issue except that if you look at it wrong it cracks I dropped a wood lip liner pencil on my phone and the edge chipped and cracked like Id just dropped it on cement Absolutely ridiculous for what I paid for it Replaced it once thinking it was a fluke then pulled my phone out of my purse to find the same issue from the phone just being inside of my purse Not worth the money Ill just buy a cheap replacement on amazon ,negative
I had the GEEK SQUAD install my cover at BEST BUY The results were not as well as I would have liked He broke the first one and got another off the shelf and then told meIf this one breaks or chips no problem just email the manufacturer and they will replace it It doesnt seem to fit the curve of the phone I purchased the name brand to go with that phone The cover is dull and not as transparent as I like I have purchased glass covers before and I have been satisfied The cost of the glass cover and installation was about 50 dollars I will possibly buy somewhere else and save money next time ,positive
There is a slight curve on the edges of the Galaxy S7 so the screen protector doesnt touch the whole screen I dropped it once on my kitchen floor and the corner cracked Theres already a ton of dust in the 18th inch gaps around the edge and Ive only had the phone for 4 days The only good thing is that I was told you can register your product online and get a lifetime warranty so you could keep replacing them but it may not be worth the hassle if you have to replace it oftenOn a positive note it does protect from scratches in the middle of the screen ,negative
I had the same thing for my S5 and the lifetime guarantee was a godsend I had to pay for shipping but I used it at least 45 times over 25 years Im not a fan of the otterboxlifeproof style screen covers personally But Im as clumsy as anyone and the screen wouldve been cracked many times over without the glass For the S7 the only drawback is this version doesnt bend to cover the curved edges So eventually the edges will get dirty Thats why only 4 stars But currently it seems like all the curved screen protectors dont stay on too well yet So this is a decent compromise ,positive
This particular Zagg shield for the Samsung Galaxy S7 has issues I have had at least 3 replacements since I got my phone last summer The way that it curves along the face of the phone is a slight bevel therefore dirt and dust and fuzz accumulate around the edges all the time even using an Otterbox My sons has cracked twice and every once in awhile we get them slightly defective out of the box Zagg is a super company with amazing customer service so returning it if registered online is never a problem but you do pay 599 for shipping and a new one is always sent out ,negative
For all our familys smartphones and tablets weve purchased InvisibleShield products The current Glass HD styles are very good Theyre easy to place on the devices screen and protect from wear and tear On a couple of occasions the protector broke but it protected the devices screen just as advertised With the lifetime warranty its a simple process to contact Zagg and a replacement shield is mailed Well continue to purchase InvisibleShield products in the future ,positive
If I could rate this product for zero stars I would Touch ability was not compromised The problem with this product is that you can not keep it on the phone long enough to get decent use out of it Samsung Galaxy S 7 The product will not lie flat on the screen edges it lifts on the screen edges causing air bubbles together between the protector and the phone screen Also it chips and cracks constantly The phone is not subject to a harsh environment it mainly stays on my desk or in my pocket Exchange process is poor Not recommended at least for this application ,negative
For the price you pay for the tempered glass you kinda think they would have the design worked out the Galaxy S7 Not the Edge has a slight curve to the screen This specific product is straight and will cause problems do not waste your money Zagg is aware of the situation but doesnt have a set time when they will have replacements for them you can see down below with the picture ,negative
When I dropped the phone this saved my screen But the downside waseven though you get one free replacement guarantee Make sure the Zagg Company sends you the right size After the broken screen was taken off it was discovered it was the wrong size So I had to buy another one from Best Buy in order to protect my phone The Zagg company was sorry and is ending me another of the correct sizeof which I do not need now Of course it has been over 3 weeks and I have not seen it I am not pleased with this situation ,positive
for big things big solutions our technology is increibe in a screen we have a complete world but that would be of the world without the adequate protections for our treasures smart phones screens cases and all that but the most incredible that a blink of applications you can handle from the lumimacion of your house asta video cameras and alarms is very interesting to see how the technology advances ,positive
Purchased this out of necessity after getting a new phone and wanted protection from day one Had this on for a day and it began detaching from the outer edges on both sides of the screen It also cracked from the slightest bump into a Formica counter top that fell from my hand that was laying on the table top Dont waste your money on this junk have had much better luck buying 5 ones that last longer and are much cheaper to replace since you still have to pay for shipping handling despite the supposed lifetime warranty to receive a replacement ,positive
Bought one at Verizon for my sons S7 and it was perfect I liked it so much I bought a second here at Best Buy for my S7 unfortunately it isnt perfect there is a 18th inch halo around the perimeter that allows particles under the screen protector I will contact ZAGG for a replacement I hope the replacement is better5 Stars for quality of the glass itself 2 Stars for consistency of their adhesive If you dont mind going back to ZAGG for replacements I would recommend if not dont bother ,positive
It is OK but I would feel safer with the glass protection I had on my S5 Because the Pt case is useless the case falls off when i am holding it and when the phone drops the case splits off immediately the screen protector started peeling off after I had it on for 20 minutes I even waited 48 hours after having BB put the Zagg on before putting the case on so this is absolutely a case issue but if it were the glass version it wouldnt be able to peel off so easilyVery disappointed overallcase screen protector wireless chargero ,negative
The problem is the slightly curved edge on the S7 Some screen protectors are short and just cover the flat part Others go edgetoedge but leave about 18 inch on each side that is not completely flat against the glass This one goes edge to edge It interferes a bit when typing at the edge like q p 1 0 or using the extreme edges but is something I got used to I use it with a Speck cover and havent noticed dirt or dust get under the edges even though I regularly run on dusty trails Ill put yes to recommend but really you decide ,negative
Great product good clarity good sensitivity with touch but As noted in other reviews it does not seal around the sides due to the rounding of the edge of the screen Pairing with a good case like and Otterbox or similar can help close the gap a little keep some of the pocket lint at bay I would recommend this product but with warning that it will probably have a shortened lifespan because of the ability of dirt and lint to get under the edge of the glass For that same reason I can only give it 3 out of 5 stars ,positive
I purchased the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 and only until after the Geek Squad installed it on my phone I saw that it did not curve where the phone did Matter of fact I ended up calling Zagg to ask if their product was made that way and the customer service rep I spoke with said it was indeed made that way and since the S7 was released theyve created the Glass Curve I was able to get a refund from Best Buy to purchase a screen protector that actually fit my phone ,positive
The screen protector does what it is supposed and protects the screen however the rounded edges of the Galaxy S7 create a halo effect The halo effect is due to the protector not being flush with the screen on the edges therefore making it very easy to crack Didnt have the phone more more than a week before I had cracks all over the protector just from normal every day use Had the same protector on my old Galaxy S4 and never had this problem in 2 years Im considering just taking the protector off because the cracks obstruct the view of the screen ,negative
First of all I want to say that Zagg is an awesome company with an incredible customer service department The are fast will do everything they can to assist you I have had their products on several different phones they were incredible I didnt read the reviews for this product because of the trust I had Big mistake Same as everyone else here i have the halo because of slight bevel in glass How it has got almost 4 star rating is beyond me Dont buy this BB take it off the shelf please Still waiting to hear back from Zagg customer service ,positive
As most I hate screen protectors mainly because its so hard to get the air bubbles out doesnt feel like a screen anymore With the invisibleshield its simple to put on doesnt take anything away from the screen Unfortunately after 2 weeks of use the screen protector accidentally lifted up I pressed it back down not expecting anything of it When I was able to take a look at my phone I discovered my screen protector had broken when I went to take it off it shattered in a glass shattering effect Its a great product but pretty fragile ,negative
Im not particularly excited about this product Pros easy to apply and through instructions it does protect my screen and is on the thick side very clear an no bubbles because of it being glass Cons because of the thickness I need to press a bit harder on the touchscreen doesnt lay flat on the edges cracked on the edge within 2 days and now there are many shatters along the edges Im guessing in part because of the lifted edges I think 40 is a bit too much to pay for this item but Im glad its at least holding up for protection ,positive
The product is good but after a few weeks the product is starting to lift at the corners of phone This makes for a annoying sight and continuous smoothing of the product that doesnt adhere to the phone anymore For the price i would think this wouldnt happen The product does the job and does not restrict functioning I wonder how long before it starts getting bigger and doesnt serve its purpose I paid Geek Squad to do the install of the shield to avoid issues like this I did read this was an issue but didnt think it would be immediate as it was ,negative
I wanted a good screen protector for my Samsung S7 The only problem is not the fault of the screen protector but because the screen on the S7 is ever so slightly curved Since the screen protector is glass it gets these tiny little cracks on the right and left side of it However this has not caused a problem with my use of the screen nor do the cracks expand I knew this might happen before I bought it as the salesperson let me know it might happen which was goodI didnt feel ripped off when it did happen ,negative
I recently bought a Zagg screen protector from a different retailer and it was terrible I felt it was my application that was the issue and a lesser version We bought a better version from Best buy and at first appeared to be better However the edges wouldnt adhere on either side Its exactly the same on each It looked like it should have been for an Edge S7 not regular S7 We checked to see if that was the case but it was notIts annoying but im not spending anymore money on a protector until I need to ,negative
I thought I would upgrade from the Zagg plastic protectors Ive used in the past and buy a glass one for my new Galaxy S7 Big mistake The glass on the phone is curved the screen protector is flat There is therefore about 5mm of the edge where the screen protector is not in contact with the glass The is going to invite dust and dirt between the phone and the protector Im returning mine tomorrow ,negative
My previous phone died but I had it awhile so when I got a new phone I had to get a screen protector Whoa The prices have gone up in the past few years That was an eyeopener but that said Im glad that I have a screen protector This product was easy to put on and take off if adjustment needed It doesnt interfere in functionality Overall it does what I need so while it was pricey to me it was also worth it ,negative
I have been buying Zagg protectors for years and this is the first time I have had a problem I have had this for about 3 weeks The Best Buy rep said that the halo effect would go away within a week What actually happened is the halo effect caused lint to accumulate and caused cracking at the edges within a week 3 weeks in and there are 4 chunks missing from the edges I keep this phone in my pocket about 90 of the time and have never dropped the phone It makes the edges of the screen nearly impossible to use Terrible product ,negative
The screen protector is easy to install clear easy to see through however the screen doesnt respond as quick or as well with it as with other clear protectorsAlso this unit had a small chip on the upper left hand corner which I decided to ignore The chip has been increasing in size and it looks as it theres another starting on the left edge about halfway down the phoneOnce this protector flakes to the point it interfears with the phone screen Ill take it out and get something else ,positive
Bought 2 of these when we upgraded our phones Supposedly these were the best ones they had for the Samsung Galaxy 7 We had the employee put them on before we left with the new phones The edges underneath the whole cover already has collected a ton of dust on both phones One has collected so much underneath that it got flipped up and cracked the corner of my screen shield Pretty disappointed since we havent even had them a full month Next time Ill just buy some cheap universal screen protector because those cost less and have the same result ,negative
I purchased the ZAGG shield primarily because I had cracked 2 screens on two of my phone in the last 2 months and it was on sale I bought it for my S7 and had the store associate affix it The end result is a 3mm perimeter that doesnt adhere to the glass Apparently even the regular S7 ie non edge is rounded on the edges This creates a visible line where the glass shield is raised above the phone screen and has the potential of collecting dust and making it more visible ,negative
I have purchased a lot of zagg screen protectors for everything from my cell phones to tablets and have loved their products This is the first product that has proven to be inferior in use The problem with this Samsung screen protector is the sides of the phone screen are curved down and the screen protector tends to come up off the sides You can not make it stay down and to take it up and try to reapply it does not work I would have thought Zagg would have came up with a solution to this before putting it out on the market ,positive
Love thr zaag glass screen protection and the feel of glass but not a fan of the s7 version that adds the pocket lint boarder The overall dimensions of the screen protector are perfect amd it feels great only downside is the s7 glass is curved slightly at the sides and the zaag glass is not You end up with a not so nice gap around the edges after about 2 days Then the pocket lint sstarts to collect and after a week you have a very visible lifted edge with fuzz Lifting it to clean only makes it worse over time ,positive
I started purchasing the glass screen protectors when i saw how it literally kept my wifes actual phone screen from cracking She cracked 2 different glass screen protectors but the phone itself was fine However the design for the s7 sucked The edges wouldnt stay down they seemed lifted I had to go back the day after purchasing to get a new one and while the associate tried his best even with the new one the edges wouldnt stay down so I had to purchase a different type of screen protector If zaag will fix the design it would be 5 star ,negative
Ive boughtapplied many Zagg glass screen protectors in my time Usually they are fantastic This was not the case this time The screen on an S7 is slightly curved on the edge obviously not as much as the S7 edge but a curve nonetheless is presentThe screen protector is just slightly too large and does not lay flush with the screen on the extreme edges Its not terribly noticeable but considering youll be looking at the phone all the time it will start to bother you ,negative
As with the several phones I have had these on in the past this screen protector has saved my actual screen from a great deal of damage This was a replacement for the same protector that I have had on the phone for about 18 months now While the protector was broken on most of the corners it did its job perfectlyThe protector WILL NOT seat on the edges of the Galaxy S7 because the screen is slightly rounded right at the edge This does not affect the protection though ,positive
The majority was right I was hoping the sides coming unattachedup would be minimal and I would just deal with it since I liked the idea of having the glass version of a screen protector WRONG the worst product Ive had yet Sides came up which then moved inward to the point that only the center section of the screen had the adhesive sticking Heed the warnings do not purchase The only saving grace is the companies replacement warranty which was used to replace it with a new option of screen protection ,positive
This screen protector is very pricey and should be perfect for the price Unfortunately it is far from it As other reviews have stated the edges of the screen protector do not adhere to the screen because of the slight curve It also does not reach to the edge of the screen to protect all of the front I should have kept my receipt because this product is not worth buying at all ,positive
Clarity and touch is great UNTIL it cracks on the edge For me it was the swipe screen to unlock that did it And then the hairline cracks start to appear and then it just becomes unusual The clarity is pointless at this point It started after only a couple of months A huge disappointment and waste of money I emailed zagg they said theyd replace it with the same onethe curved one is on backorder This product should be RECALLED best buy should refund the purchase price Bestbuy says to contact ZAGG ,negative
This is the best insurance you can ever buy to protect your phones screen I have dropped my phone on multiple occasions and at least twice I thought I had cracked the screennope it was only the screen protector which Zagg cheerfully replaced Do not waist your money buying a less expensive product because as they say you get what you pay for Also in addition to the protection of the screen the product reduces glare and allows for easy cleaning of smudges and fingerprints Again BEST accessory for a phone ,negative
I had another similar product which also worked great but I beat it up pretty bad while my phone was in a Fanny Pack I thought I actually broke the glass so I went to a Phone repair shop They directed me to Best Buy after telling me it was the cover not the Glass I damaged Best Buy installed it and until now I forgot I even bought it Its great and barely know its there Recommend for sure and recommend the Professional Install ,positive
This is my first time buying a glass screen protector an probably my last Ive always gotten invisableshield but never the glass Stick with the nonglass ones and youll never be disappointed I currently have 3 cracks and scratches and I cant remember dropping it ever in the last 3 months Ive had it any more than like 23 ft and its already trashed Not very thrilled It does NOT fit the galaxy 7 very well and theres a huge lift around the screen causing dust an junk to get in and make it look dirty ,negative
I used it for some time BUT I should have listened to the sales person who warned me that it does not fit perfectly on my SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 Cell Phone It had a 2mm ring around the whole display where it did not attach to the glass screen which is curved backwards I wanted some protection against scratches so I left it on until these edge which did not bend to the form of the glass collected to much dirt and i removed itSo 2 points for the time it workedBUT Do NOT use it for the SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 ,negative
I had read how the standard S7 has a rounded screen near the edges and that tempered glass protectors werent fitting quite right I was assured by BRB that this wasnt true for this protector Well it is So the left and right edges have 23 mm line along each edge that looks like a bubble but is just the curvature in the screen It doesnt affect anything but I was upset that the staff was either misinformed Still I would rather have my screen protected than not so I kept it Shouldnt cost as much as it does or the poor aesthetics ,negative
My Samsung 7 was going on 2 years and developed several cracks in the protective glass screen I went to Best Buy BB to see what types of glass screens they had The member of the staff recommended I go with the ZAGG Invisible Shield Glass Not only was it a drastic improvement in the clarity of the screen but I saved a considerable amount because it was on sale It was also worth the cost of having BB install the glass as they did a truly superb job Another well done for Best Buy ,positive
As nearly ever reviewer has noted the flat design does not fit the curvature of the glass on the edges of the Galaxy S7 From their web site I can see that they are working on a new one I understand that this happens when products are produced without the exact specifications I get that But I sincerely hope that I will not have to pay an additional 40 or more to buy the same product that I thought I was buying the first time ,positive
Its great for protecting my phone screen from getting scratched but honestly for the price I payed for this I dont like the way it collects dust and dirt around the edges one of the corners seems to want to come up and now I have a Crack in the bottom with a piece thats ready to break off right down by my button This isnt supposed to Crack or break and I havent done anything to it so I dont understand especially since it does have a case around it So for the enormous price I wouldnt do this one again ,negative
I BOUGHT THIS SCREEN COVER BECAUSE THE SALESPERSON SAID THEY WERE GOOD AND I HAD BOUGHT A THINNER CASE SO I WANTED THE EXTRA PROTECTION FOR MY SCREEN HOWEVER WITHIN DAYS THE SCREEN HAD SCRATCHES ON IT FROM SLIDING IT IN AND OUT OF PURSE I GUESS IVE IT A LITTLE OVER 2 MONTHS NOW AND THE SIDES OF THE SCREEN COVER ARE CRACKING OFF AT LEAST ITS THE COVER AND NOT THE ACTUAL PHONE BUT FOR THE PRICE I WISH I WOULDVE JUST BOUGHT THE CHEAPER ONES I CAN AFFORD TO REPLACE EVERY FEW MONTHS INSTEAD ,negative
I bought this for my new s7 after having great experiences with other Zagg glass screen protectors on other phones and tablets I installed it on my phone but it never really looked rightI noticed the edges were blurry and I was getting lint and other fuzzies stuck to the edge of the screen protector I then read reviews on BestBuycom and saw that many other people were having the same problems I pulled the screen protector off my phone and returned it to my local store Ill wait for Zagg to release the curved version ,negative
I had never had a tempered glass cover before just screen protectors Got phone out of purse one dayand the tempered glass cover was cracked At that point I had never dropped my phone or had it in any situation that would have caused that shattering of the screen protector That being said if there was a situation and I was unaware my screen was totally untouched However I went back to screen protectors only not the tempered glass Suppsed to have Gorilla glass anyway so I am saving my ,negative
Got a new phone and repurchase this for my new phone Both my husband and I had them for are old phones and we never broke our screen We did have to replace it once on my phone my preschooler launched my phone and 2 times for my husband hes just hard on stuff constructionmechanic Just make sure you register with Zagg right away saves time looking for the receipt later All in all 599 for replacement shipping way better than new screen protector or new phone because the screens broken ,negative
I returned a screen protector that I had bought when I first got my new phone That protector was supposed to fit my phone but kept coming up around the edges Went into the Best Buy Tracy and I talked to the department manager she determined that the problem was with the protector that I previously had purchased She installed the new protector and I immediately saw a difference She refunded me for my old one and completed the sale of the new one Surprised my wife and I as to the professional service we received ,negative
This product would be acceptable if it fit the phone screen properly Left and right sides of screen protector do not match the contour of phone screen you can see a border where the screen protector does not contact the phone screen This in turn causes the screen protector to interfere with the phone case on the lower corners screen protector peels up on lower cornersBottom line something this expensive needs to fit properly ,positive
Right after I bought it because of the stupid design The sides cracked They just came out with the correct design called the curve that covers the whole thing What an upgrade that one is AWESOME But forget about getting your phone wet Learned the hard way Once you put on the curve model and get it wet You will need to use the warranty as the water stays between the zagg and the glass of the phone 399 and got a new one on the way So make sure you dont buy this one for the S7 You need the s7 curve model ,negative
For a think piece of glass film it is pricey It doesnt appear to affect the touch screen and is able to stay relatively clean and clear smudge resistant It protects the screen well cracked in multiple places when dropped but my screen was undamaged The limited lifetime warranty helps so you can get a replacement if the glass cracks but the shipping fees are expensive for the free replacement Customer service for ZAGG has been great regarding the replacement ,negative
I have loved the glass products for my iPhones This one for the Galaxy S7 did not live up to expectations Even though my phone is not the S7 Edge the screen has a slight curve at the edges Since this Glass screen cover is rigid it does not follow the curve around the perimeter of the screen leaving a 2mm gap I realize that 2mm is not much but I would expect a product that is listed as being for this particular phone would have a perfect fit ,positive
In less than 30 days of use this item is cracked and there are 4 shattered edges When the edges shatter they are sharp like glass A piece got stuck in my finger and it was difficult to extract I do not abuse my items as the last similar product I had different brand lasted for over 2 years without any damage I have not idea why this product is so fragile The clarity is very good but the product itself is too fragile for general use I will need to return it for credit or replacement ,negative
I love the concept but the execution is poor Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect anything different but if you are going to provide a screen shield for a phone with a slightly beveled edge I would expect it either to work with the bevel or stop short so that the shield fully adheres to the screen This was never the case and I even paid extra to have it professionally installed at Best Buy From the very first the edges didnt adhere and began collecting dust making my phone seem dirty I finally gave up on it ,negative
The Samsung S7 has a slight curve on the edges which make this glass protector not fit properly It does not adhere properly as mine cracked within a few days and I dont drop or mishandle my phone My son also has the same phone but he has a heavy duty Otter Box case and his has not cracked He is more abusive with his phone Hopefully they have corrected the glass screen by now as I have had it about 6 months now Zagg does offer lifetime warranty so they do replace it you just pay for shipping cost ,negative
my old screen protector cracked when I rolled onto it doing some work in the garage with a bolt in my pocket the device screen was untouched so this purchase was pretty mindless the young woman that helped me knew exactly what I needed and installed it quickly and perfectly the screen is perfect and use is flawless with regard to the touchscreen performance I would purchase this again in a heartbeat and track down the young woman that helped me anytime I am in the store ,positive
Not only does it not contour to the screen of my phone but it also cracks very easily I have only had it a week and it has 3 cracks I know how one happened when it hit the countertop in the bathroom when I was putting it down No idea about the other 2 Very disappointing since I decided to pay more for quality Product is registered with Zagg but I dont even want a replacement if its just going to break again and again They still make you pay shipping and handling for a poorly made product ,negative
I was very excited to see that zagg had the screen protectors out early this launch but when I got home and put on the screen I noticed it didnt fully adhere to the edges of the screen Went back to return it right away Their pro at putting on protectors said it was placed perfectly and he didnt know why it was lifting Got my money back and went to an actual zagg store where they said that the curved glass wont be coming out for a bit ,positive
The screen does it job I wont argue that but it isnt like the video trailer describing the product claimed Hammers and fireworks werent supposed to damage this Its supposed to be military grade but on the bottom right corner not even a week after putting it on my teeth not even a hard bite cracks it A drop to the ground made a half circle crack The phone is protected to my knowledge but the screen shouldnt be damaged from this Not if it was as described ,negative
Purchased this product at the recommendation of a Best Buy employee who had used it on another phoneWhen I installed it i noticed the edges would did not make contact with the phone The S7 has a downward slope around the edge of the screen and because this product is not flexible it cant wrap around the screenVery disappointed with this product it really should be pulled off the store shelves ,positive
With the high price of cell phones today it pays to invest in a screen protector I have used the plastic screen protectors in the past and found that they make the screen a little cloudy and the images are not crystal clear This time I purchased the tempered glass protector and I am very pleased with it The screen looks perfectly clear and you dont even realize that there is a screen protector on The tempered glass may cost a little more but it is worth it and Zagg always stands by their products ,positive
I left the store with this applied Because it is glass it has no flexibility and the surface of the s7 seems to have somewhat rounded edges so it leaves this shield lifted up just a hair on the edges It cracked EVERY SINGLE TIME the screen hit something in my bag or pocket ZAGG was great super warranty but seriously do you want to replace it every week Go with a ZAGG top of the line screen protector made with military grade componentsbest screen protector ever ,positive
Normally I swear by Zagg products I have purchased many Zagg screen protectors at least 3 Zagg keyboards and one pair of Zagg earphones Before now I would give every product 5 stars But this screen protector is the first that began peeling up after only 2 weeks We let the Best Buy employee apply the protector so perhaps they did something wrong We have not yet contacted Zagg for a replacement I expect that their customer service will be excellent as it has been in the past ,negative
I dropped my phone and it landed face down on a concrete pad The screen protector cracked in many places BUT save my phone screen from even the slightest nick Way Cool I went and purchased another one at the store due to not wanting my phone unprotected while waiting on the shipping time then went through the process of paying 700 for shipping to get another protector from ZAGG I then returned the replacement protector to the store for a credit back to my account ,negative
Zagg glass worked wonderfully on my S5 However on the S7 the glass doesnt lay flat on the edges There appears to be a slight curve to the edge of the screen which prevents the Zagg protector from adhering on the sides I dont know if this will affect the performance of the screen protector or if it is only a cosmetic problem Zagg protectors have worked well in the pastfor me so Im keeping it on the screen for now I would recommend Zagg products but not this one for the S7 ,positive
I have this protector on my S7 As far as touch and swiping works fine No major scratches detected Problem is there is a halo effect on the outer edge of the screen protector Quite noticeable at first but you get use to it That halo problem becomes another issue when the edge of the protector cracks The phone is fine but the screen protector is now cracked at the edge which makes me wonder if the warranty is worth a dn Has the screen protector become compromised at this point ,negative
After trying generic glass screen protectors that were terrible I decided to bite the bullet and get the very expensive ZAGG branded protector I think the price is far too high compared to their competitors but I digress My main quarrel with this protector is that it collects dirt and lint on the edges since the screen is rounded Not sure if ANY screen protector can full cover the new Galaxy phones and I find that to be very unfortunate Otherwise this protector mostly gets the job done ,negative
Im on my second one in a month The first was applied by the BB sales guy on my S7 standard He said that it would seal on the edges overnight but that never happened It cracked within 3 weeks I used the lifetime warranty and got another from Zagg had to pay 5 shipping I applied the new one and its the same thing My guess is that there is a minuscule curve on the edges of the screen and the Zagg glass wont bend to sealDont bother with this product ,negative
Best Buy staff put the screen protector on my phone and there were a couple small bubbles I recently noticed that the screen protector has some large scratches on it The phone is usually in a pocket in my purse or on the counter There is nothing in that pocket of my purse where the phone is and there is no zipper on that pocket it is made for a cell phone and it hasnt fallen or anything to scratch it like that Not sure how good that fortified tempered glass construction is ,negative
Not to great of a product 1st you had to pay the price then pay to have a warranty then it is extra for them to put the glass on the phone I didnt pay extra to have it placed on on my phone for me as I thought it would be simple to put onWRONG ANSWER Now my warranty apparently doesnt cover any of it Wasted money like if that is the policy then please advise your customer Thanks for the heads up ,positive
There is another review about how this protector doesnt lay against the phone the edges are lifted I took a chance and that review is true I like how the protector is thicker which provides better protections but since Samsung S7 not the edge screens rounds off at the edges this protector doesnt seal all the way itll do for now until i pick up a thinner one that has more flexibility ,positive
I bought my new phone and put this on it to protect the screen Of course I dropped my phone a few times before i got a case that I liked The glass took the brunt of the drops This screen did crack after dropping the phone a few times but just around the edge My phone was perfect though Zagg honored their warranty and a replacement was quickly sent out to me without a lot of hassle Now I am back to a perfect phone again Well worth the price for the lifetime warranty that comes with this ,positive
Zagg usually makes excellent screen protectors but this one misses the mark I followed the instructions precisely and on a brand new phone since this is the autorecommended screen protector when you buy at best buy and the edges never adhered Its also just enough smaller than the phone that there is space between it and the edges of my very typical case After two weeks of light use the protector started shattering around the edges ,positive
I have always bought ZAGG and have always loved it until this item I never leave reviews either but was so disappointed I had to warn future consumers This screen protector doesnt touch the right or left side and is currently just collecting dust ZAGG says it was made for the curve of the phone and it obviously was not otherwise every review wouldnt be complaining about this Waste of 40 DO NOT BUY ,negative
I bought this when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 and it had a crack in one of the edges within the first day of just being in my pocket Since than the the cracks have spread all along the bottom and there are chips out of the screen protector all along the edges They also didnt account for the slight curve of the screen on the S7 and this lets dirt and dust build up along the sides of the screen For 40 this should have held up way better very disappointed ,negative
I have used this tempered glass screen protectors on all my phones They really do keep your screen from getting broken Dropped my phone many times I have never cracked my phones screen I have cracked the glass but never my phones glass They will replace it through their online site Its warrantied for life I have sent the old one back and received a new one for like 499 shipping charge only You only have to send the old one back so dont throw it away ,negative
I bought this screen protector and after dropping my phone from about 1 ft off the ground the screen protector cracked I received my replacement with my lifetime warranty however the new protector cracked on the edge just from being in my bag Its nice that you are able to replace it just having to pay shipping However its quite inconvenient having to go thru the process 2 time in just under 1 month Id stick with a screen protector that isnt made of this glasslike plastic ,negative
They all broke and cracked including the last one I had put on my phone I just feel that for the phone I have the screen protector should have a little more flexibility Each time I tried taking the cover off of my phone the screen protector cracked to pieces However this is the best one for my phone so I just think that because my phone is beveled not many options are available I have always used this brand and have had no issues ,negative
The Zagg cover for the Samsung Galaxy S7 is probably Zaggs worst product ever Its size is correct but Zagg didnt seem to anticipate the curved edges of the S7 screen So even with a phone case dust or pocket fuzz will get under the edges of the Zagg glass Not sure how this will play out long term but if you want the added comfort to protect your screen then buy one If youd rather send a message to Zagg that this isnt up to their high set standard then dont ,positive
When the shield was applied there was a fine line around the edges that remained dry no matter what we did It is slowly getting larger I have registered the product on Zagg and will pursue a replacement A post found online for this product had similar problem and was noted that some Best Buy stores had an incorrect product for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Hoping for a resolution for replacement from Zagg so althoough it seems like an ok product no recommendation yet ,negative
The glass is flat but the screen is curved at the edge so the glass does not adhere to the screen edgetoedge Any pressure on the side of the glass causes it to lose contact with the screen This also happened with the case I purchased in the store It pressed against the side of the glass I bought a UAG Urban Armor Gear case that is rigid around the glass and doesnt touch the screen I still have a halo around the sreen edge but it disappears when the screen is active ,negative
The screen protector cracked within a week of purchasing and I was not mishandling my phone Surprised for a product that offers a lifetime guarantee Its still on my phone and does protect the screen from scratches so havent bothered returning to get a replacement Also seems overpriced for what it is just a thin piece of plastic seems like it would cost only pennies to produce the kind of thing used as packaging that you would just throw away ,negative
This is a very pricey cover especially since it doesnt cover the entire glass like my original It is also not making good contact on the edge yes it is the correct model for my phone Best Buy tech warned me that this was normal for the glass Even so the glass is very smooth and phone is more responsive than with the original glass I purchased Overall it does what it is meant to and havent had any problems with it ,positive
Had best buy install the glass shield Had some concern because it is glass but the best buy salesman convinced me it was great Next day it was cracking on edges before long the screen was cracking everywhere Cant return to best buy tried but customer servicewas so sorry we dont stand behind our products go deal with Zagg However their return process is ok and let me exchange the glass shield for a plastic one which works great ,positive
Im very happy with this great product This was highly recommended by our Best Buy Rep who also gladly and expertly installed it It offers durable and lasting protection for my iPhone which is a major investment for me My wife and family have used this on their phones and this company has stood behind their replacement policies So Between my family Best Buy Rep recommendations it was an easy decision to invest in this extra protection ,positive
Bought yesterday and had it installed by best buy employee Was told that the edges of protector would adhere overnight Woke up to use phone and edge of protector cracked from light finger pressure Will be returning today Stay away until they make a product that works with the slight screen couture of the s7 ,positive
Ive used this product before on several phones and its been fantastic However because the edges of the screen on the S7 are slightly curved and the glass is apparently not there is a small gap between the two that causes shadowing along the edges and after a couple days of light usage the edges will begin to chip away This not only looks bad but causes a sharp edge that will catch on everything and could cause injured fingers ,positive
The screen does not fit the phone at all It cracks on the corners easily I have only had the screen protector for a month and had to replace it once because the corner cracked then cracked across the whole screen The second on I got the corner cracked and I even have a case on the phone This product is junk and I would not tell anyone to purchase these I was a hugh Zagg fan in the past and have always purchased them for my phones but never again ,negative
I have always heard good things about the zagg screen protectors so I decided to buy one when I got my s7 Worked well for about a week then I noticed a scratch that went almost down the whole screen Just from being in my purse and possibly my keys were against it Not good for claiming to be scratch resistant I already ordered my warranty replacement screen If you buy this definitely register it If this second screen scratches Im changing brands for sure ,negative
i was super excited about this screen protector because with the built in water resistance of the Galaxy S7 i knew all i would have to worry about is bumps and scratches however after application exactly according to the instructions the glass peeled up around the edges it did not conform to the shape of the screen very disappointing that said best buy customer service was excellent and upon seeing why i was dissatisfied refunded the purchase ,negative
The shield worked for a Samsung7 but I have the edge They stop making them for the Edge so I decided to try one for the 7 It worked but did not protect the EDGE of the phone It also caused a delay when i touched the screen Since the shield didnt fit the edges it collected a lot of dirt and looked old I ended up taking off the shield and getting a flimsy screen protector which only protects the screen against scratches not drops ,negative
The screen protector does not fit the curvature of the phone There is a halo around the edge of it that attracts dirt and dust particles Screen protector was damaged when trying to use the Gear VR Not sure if this was due to dirt under the edge or not Needed a screen protector at the time but if I would have known the fit I would have probably choose another protector The company was supposedly going to make a new protector so it fits properly ,negative
My girlfriend has it on her Samsung galaxy s7 not edge I noticed that I believe because the edges of the phone are slightly curved while the screen is not that the glass is not completely flush with the screen the other day she said she hit her finger on the screen by accident and she now has a small chip on the very top of the screen protector it is a good product you just need to be careful with it I would personally buy the glass curve the next time ,positive
So my favorite part about ZAGG is that they have an awesome warranty setup Seems in part because they really need to The protectors work but they are fragile and sometimes dont properly adhere to the device The adhering to the case is the issue that I experienced where it wont properly adhere to the edges Theyre cool about sending another though so well see if the second one has an easier time ,positive
I think that this product is a good sense of protection for my new Galaxy S7 but I wish the edges of the screen protector would have stayed adhered to the glass surface The edges are a bit cloudy due to the protector not staying adhered to the glass I even paid 7 for Best Buy employees to install the protector Maybe I will take it back and ask them to fix it Other than that it is a great product and I feel good about investing in this product ,positive
Dont buy for the S7 I was told how great the Zagg Glass Screen was Unfortunately I started seeing cracks along the edges and I hadnt dropped my phone When I went back to Best Buy where it was purchased and installed I was told that could happen if it was bumped against something I pushed back and the sales people finally confirmed with the Samsung rep that there was a known defect between the design of the S7 and the design of the Glass Screen ,negative
I have used zagg screen protectors and always been happy Purchased 2 Galaxys S7s and zagg invisibleshield glass protectors Within two weeks screen protector was coming loose on one phone and ended up breaking On both phones the glass protectors does not make contact with the curvature of the phone on the sides of the screen Luckily one of the phones has a case that covers the sides so screen protector cant catch on anything ,negative
This screen protector is a lot of money for a screen protector It is not worth buying The glass does not cover the edges at all It collects more lint then my dryer can It is very bad and I am very disappointed I bought 4 screen protectors from zagg prior to this one They all fit great This one does not fit well Find another screen protector this one will make your phone ugly ,negative
This was a lifesaver for my wife She got a cracked screen from a student at her school she works at and so after she got the screen replaced she bought this product and the same thing happened again except this time the Zagg cracked and not the screen You got a full replacement on the screen protector and shes back in business I recommend this to anyone who needs extra protection on their phone screen ,positive
I purchased the glass screen as a recommendation from the sales associate Paid the 8 to have him put it on Within two weeks it is peeling off and the edges have splintered and cracked in three different places I hope Zagg will stand behind their warranty but I also hope Best Buy will take accountability for a poor placement on the phone as well Not worth paying for the glass I never had issues with the plastic shield for 3 years ,negative
Theres been no noticeable decrease in touch sensitivity after applying the thick protector And it is THICK so unless you go at it with a saw youre not going to scratch the screen underneathThe only imperfection is around the edges The S7 not the Edge version still has a slight slope around its edges which this protector will not adhere to This leaves a small amount of room for dust or lint to get in there and get stuck to the adhesive ,negative
I had a Zagg glass protector for my Galaxy S5 and it served me well saving my phone many times When I upgraded to the S7 Edge I quickly bought this Zagg screen protector The edges keep peeling the included activator doesnt hold the protectors edges the protector is so thin that it is pretty much impossible to squeeze out all the air bubbles Its like cutting a piece of Saran or Glad Wrap and sticking it on the phones screen ,positive
This screen protector is 85 great Even though I have the standard S7 there is a small curve on each side built into the screen This screen protector does not match this contour so there are strips on each side of the screen without the screen protector adhering So far I have not had an issue getting buildup under these edges but there is a color difference between where the screen protector touches and does not touch the screen ,negative
I bought two new phones and this Zagg product for each phone Now three months later both Zagg screens are toast One has a crack running from top to bottom of the screen The other has several fractures that started at the edge of the screen and spread into the center I know that my phone one of the two phones has never been dropped In addition it is in an Otter case for safety Yet the Zagg shield is cracked from top to bottom ,negative
I tried another glass screen protector and the fit was terribleit didnt fit the edges and started peeling off from the top edges from the start Had to replace within 3 months This screen protector sticks to screenbut the entire rim looks like it has a uniform amount of air under it although besides for getting dust under it its still a better fit for an ill designed screen on the S7 ,positive
I was warned the edges of the glass would lift and it would be annoying I can see a lifted edge on my protector probably measuring 3 millimeters It doesnt bother me at all The screen is equally as clear with the glass it is equally as sensitive as without and I am happy with this product I love that if the company comes out with a new Zagg cover that does not lift at the edges I will be able to replace it with the new one ,positive
I paid 799 for someone at Best Buy to put it on and 2999 for the product After two days it started to crack along the edges I went back to Best Buy and due to the flu I didnt get there within the time frame so they had me call the company The company was wonderful and sent me a new glass shield free of charge The shield on my old phone is in perfect condition after 3 years but it is plastic not tempered glass ,positive
This is the first time I went with this type of screen protector So far so good I am glad the company offers life time warranty I upgraded 2 phones that day and decided that better quality accessories are worth a try We registered the protector immediately after the purchase and hope to never use the warranty but with teenagers and busy life styles something tells me we will eventually ,positive
Have had this for a few months now so far no cracks except for a small chip in the top corner where my phone landed in an otterbox case as well I do like the sensitivity it provides however the Samsung S7 has a slightly curved screen so dont expect this to reach the edges sides mine is a little less than 18 inch down the sides from making contact w the factory glassStill well worth it if you can get it on sale ,positive
I have used Zagg Shields for many years I have always had great luck with their product Being a very busy person and often grabbing up a pile of things and heading out the door is common for me This can cause problems when it comes to protecting the screen of your cell phone I have dropped my phone countless times from carpet to concrete floors Throughout these my screen has been saved by the Zagg shield ,positive
You buy this when want to be sure your screen is protected and never want to buy another screen protector This one has a lifetime warrantyOn the downside the edges of my phone screen are rounded so this protector doesnt fit perfectly and dust tends to collect under the sides Its also very expensive but thats why theres a warranty I have also heard that it does its job well being the thing that cracks instead of your screen ,negative
I was told this provides better protection on my screen I assume it has but it is cracked in 4 different places I feel like I havent been rough with it and the cracks have all come on different days My phone is really only about a month old That being said the protector is cracked but my real screen is protected and that is was it is designed to doprotectI also like how easy it is to get a warrantied replacement ,positive
The Galaxy S7 has an uneven front screen around the edges of the phone and I have been through 3 of these glass screens already because they start cracking from the outside in Ive got to take this one off because it is cracking from the outside corner again I think I am going to try the plastic instead of the glass Never had a problem with the glass screens before I actually prefer them just not for the S7 ,negative
I bought this glass screen protector and it crack the screen protector 2 days later It looked like my screen was cracked But they have unlimited replacement warrenty through zagg company So that was great My BF also bought the same glass proctector and it cracked on him as well He replaced it and it cracked again Its clear on the screen Your phone is protector Just hopefully we dont have to keep replaceing the screen protectors ,positive
Bought this product based on good experience with Zagg glass covers fro my S7 Unfortunately the sides of the screen curve a little bit and the cover will not adhere there I keep my phone in a case so other than it being a cosmetic issue it has caused me no problems No edge cracking yet I would NOT use this cover without at case though Zagg needs to find a fix and not just say to use a worthless polymer screen cover ,negative
Thick enough to prevent the screen from cracking and instead cracks itself if necessary But it does have a life time warranty that is a bit of a head ache to get a new 1 if it does break Better than the cheep screen protectors though Gave it a 4 due to the halo effects it has on my s7 not the edge Mainly shows when the phone is off or dark I can bairly see it while using the phone Overall the product servers it purpose ,negative
My little girl loves to carry around my phone and even though its a glass screen protector it still works extremely well I had a co worker that couldnt understand why i have it I promptly picked my phone up and dropped it on the cement floor She gasped loudly and when she saw there was no damage done to my phone i gave her a thats why look I love not having to worry about my screen getting shattered if my phone is dropped ,positive
Hands down the best product in this category Zagg has been continuously perfecting their craft since the beginning They dont interfere with cases and you hardly notice they are installed But they add the highest level of protection for your screen When ever I take it off the screen looks brand new They also have great customer service and provide replacements as part of the warranty ,positive
First zagg screen Ive bought that Im not satisfied with They didnt make this to fit the slightly curved screen edges on the Galaxy S7 so it just cracks Its holding up ok where it does fit flush and Ive dropped my phone with no damage But it has cracks where its not flush and I have a feeling it will continue to crack until I have to replace the whole thing Hopefully they make another one to fix this issue ,negative
This screen protector was selected by the sales associate and as stated on the package by the manufacturer is for the Galaxy s7 It protects well and feels smooth with no bubblessort of The edges of this screen cover do not exactly fit the edges of the s7 not the s7 edge and its works fine but it is slightly disappointing I think that Zagg has since released a new one and admitted that Opps this didnt quite fit ,positive
I upgraded to a Galaxy S7 three weeks later I went to California to visit family We went on a tour and as I was leaving the bus I dropped my phone face down and the screen cracked I never cracked a screen before So with much paranoia and many reviews I decided to purchase this to protect my phone So far its great I can rest know that my screen is protected and this protector has a lifetime guarantee ,positive
Ive had this same screen protector for my past phones and loved it The ONLY thing that I dont like about this one for the Galaxy S7 is that the sides dont completely adhere to the phone About 4mm not sticking to the phoneas if the phone is beveled So when grabbing my phone with another item in my hand the part not adhered cracked Still better protection than without itand it offers keeping great sensitivity for touch ,positive
The screen protector seems to hold up against drops and scratches Although it does not lay flat on the new Samsung S7s screen I am guessing due to being tempered glass it will not contour to the bend in the cell phones screen This bit of room leaves an error in space for dirt lint and dust to get under the edge of the protector and I am sure over time will cause the adhesive of the protector to stop working ,negative
This is an exceptional product Ithe redefine the next level of screen protector Aside from protecting the screen itseems easy on the eyes and finger motionHowever the installation was horrible The wait time was long plus the installer left an hair between the screen protector and the my cell Never advise if I can return to get it fixedWill not return to this particular best buy and any recommendation ,positive
The Samsung S7 standard model has a slight curve on the edges of the screen It is not a dramatic curve like the Samsung S7 Edge The Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 leaves about 1 centimeter on each side left and right that does not adhere to the screen The screen still functions but eventually the gap under the screen protector is going to fill with dust and lint ,positive
This is a must for any phone I feel It gives you extra protection for your screen I have seen so many phones with the screens shattered because of a simple drop and you cant even use the phone other than answering a call The extra protector saves the phone just in case it hits the floor Phones are so expensive these days and I cant afford to replace them so the protection I get from the protector is so worth it ,positive
I had a great experience with Zagg screen protectors in the past they honor the warranty and customer service is excellent This specific product has a design flaw and the edges do not follow the slight curvature of the screen so it stays up preventing a perfect fit The level of protection though is still amazing Im still a Zagg glass customer but the issue on the edges is the only complain ,positive
I have had InvisibleShield protectors for other phones and know that they will replace the protector is it gets damaged The cons for this one is that with the Galaxy S7 you will end up with a border on the screen Customer support said that it is due to the S7 screen being beveled slightly Also around the border I have to press harder for the phone to recognize my touch ,negative
Although stating that it is for the Galaxy S7 it does not come close to fitting the phone Why a company would make a flat piece of glass to protect a CURVED screen I dont know Why a Best Buy associate would sell this product is also puzzling Very unsatisfied complete waste of time and money Gave it a single star only because at least one star was required ,negative
I have only had the protector on my phone for over a month and its already cracke I havent had any major drops with my phone I thought this product was supposed to be shatterproofI have had other protectors on my phones and tablets that seemed to be able to withstand small drops without scratching chipping or cracking I will definitely be replacing this product through the lifetime warranty in the near future ,negative
I have had TWO of these things crack and break on me and not from falling or being struck or anything Just taking it out of my pocket and there is damage to the sides and once there is one crack like anything glass it just cracks more and more over timeZaggs lifetime warranty is free but you have to pay a minimum of 6 for shipping and I dont want to pay 6 every two months for a screen protector ,negative
The Zagg Glass Screen protector may turn out to be a wonderful protective product But right now I have to rate it soso The reason is that despite the store installing it there is still an edge that did not adhere fully The store said that was normal that despite their best efforts there is usually one corner edge that does that Given how expensive this product is that is most frustrating ,positive
The glass screen protectors are the best I have a big dog who loves to jump up and hug you and hes knocked my phone out my hands so many times hes even hit the screen with his claws Let me tell you Ive had to replace my protector at least 4 times cause its crackedbut my s tual phone screen is fine the glass zagg protector absorbs all the damage so your phone screen doesnt ,positive
Worst screen protector Ive ever owned Day 2 of having it on my new phone I already started noticing little cracks around the edge of the protector A week later my son accidentally dropped a set of keys on top of it and cracked the entire protector and part of my screen At 40 I would expect better protection than that I will never purchase another one of these ,positive
Before I had children I never needed any sort of glass shield product for my phone Ever since having little ones my phone is constantly dropped and this is the best option for it Despite all the drops my glass has NEVER been broken If you get the warranty with ZAGG in which a Best Buy agent hinted I should get they will send you a new one whenever the old one gets to broken up ,negative
This was a replacement purchase My first screen protector lasted almost three yearsbut dropping repeatedly caused a crackwhich didnt have any effect on the phone There was a recent ding as wellso decided to replacejust to be safe This one is working welland Im trying to be more carefultoo ,negative
Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 was an upgrade from an regular plastic feeling screen protector The upgrade was suggested by an employee who asked me to feel the difference from my old cell phone to his cell phone that that the glass protector on it I purchased the Zagg invisibleShied glass screen protector for the new Samsung S7 The feel of the glass protector is solid ,positive
This screen protector was recommended by the sales associate I liked the idea of the glass versus plastic and the lifetime replacement warranty The clarity is fantastic and Im pleased with it so far I have only had the phone etc about a month so havent really tested the limit of the protection as far as dropping and screen breaking but the protection from scratches and daily usage seems very good ,positive
Cracked not too long after I got it I was too lazy to swap it out Had it for less than a year now its so cracked up and chunks missing The edges did not stick down properly yes I cleaned the heck out it first Terrible product I have a decent case on my phone so theres no reason for it to have gotten as cracked up as it is from accidental drops ,negative
I bought this Zagg screen protector for my cell phone It does what it is supposed to doprotect your screen from scratches It is a thicker adhesive plastic but a pain to try to put on the phone yourselfthe staff at Best Buy will put it on your phone for youbut BEWAREthere is an ADDITIONAL 800 CHARGE for the Best Buy staff to put the screen protector on your phone ,negative
I decided to save the 799 cost to have Best Buy install this screen protector BIG MISTAKE The instructions were so confusing and by the time I got the screen placed correctly on my phone there were finger prints at the bottom that would never come out Money totally wasted I have installed other brands with no problem But if you buy this brand at Best Buy let them install it Lesson learned ,negative
Zagg does it my previous screen OB protector had chipped then cracked and I needed to replace Best Buy will even pricematch to Amazon Easy to follow instructions for install Also has lifetime warranty should when it cracks just register on Zagg website Note the glass doesnt fully adhere to the slightly tapered edges of my Samsung Galaxy S7 but hasnt caused any issues Very satisfied ,negative
Because its glass and the edges of the phone are beveled the edges of the screen protector dont adhere to the screen leaving a 2mm gap all the way around I had the plastic version in my hand and the sales girl talked me into getting this one instead because glass is so much better So I trusted her and spent more money on a protector that I had to remove and throw away Total waste of money ,positive
Seemed like a good idea at the time buying something to protect such an expensive phone Within a week of having it in place it had shattered along the edge of the camera after sharing my pocket with a golf tee It since has cracked in a few other areas along the edge The phone itself remains usable and and the screen itself seems undamaged but aesthetically it doesnt look great ,positive
Had this screen about a week before it crackes on the side of my s7 not even an edge S7 A month later it cracked again I signed up for the lifetime warranty but it costs 8 for them to send a new and it costs to hace Best Buy put it onsome lifetime warranty I feel like it protecta my screen well because it is so thick but my fingers are taking a beating from the cracks ,negative
The thought of a glass screen over a plastic one sounded like a great idea since mine was damaged by keys in the same pocket The glass is very good to look at Theres only one flaw transferring of pressure from your finger to the real screen isnt perfect That can be annoying Other than that Im happy with this product ,positive
I bought this product at the same time that I got my phone because of the risks of dropping it I guess it serves its purpose for now The sides of the glass dont stay adhered to the screen because of the screens slight curve So Im sure eventually something will catch one of the raised sides of the glass and either break it or pull it off the phone Dont waste your 40 or so dollars on this ,negative
I have used Zagg since 2006 on all of my mobile devices and have throughly enjoyed the quality While I understand that as of now no glass screen protector will fully fit the curve of the S7 why would you sell this product I am waiting for the release of the new curved glass from Zagg just not happy with the quality and decision to release an inadequate product ,positive
I love Zagg have for a long time But this one really fell short The edges dont lay down because of the slight curve to the phone It messes up the screen and looks down right awful For the price Im angry I emailed customer support through Zagg and they essentially shrugged me off Dont waste your money or time ,negative
Ive never been known to break a screen so I just wanted to get a regular screen protector Unfortunately they only had these 40 glass protectors but I figured I would never have to buy another protector Boy was I wrong It started cracking in two spots around the edge the day after I bought it I never once dropped it to cause it to crack I will not be purchasing this product again ,negative
Do to the edges not making contact with the screen the protector cracks on the edges it cracked the day after it was installed This has happened on mine and my wifes phones We are very careful with our phones and they are always in perfect condition when we trade them in I am waiting for the Zagg new curved lens cover I hope it is replaced with no issues ,negative
I used to trust ZAGG products But after this one I would not buy another ZAGG product for Samsung See my photo The gap is very noticeable on my S7 worse than on my Note 4 There is another one supposed to correct this problem but its only sold on ZAGGs website at higher price ,negative
Any time one uses a cell phone it can become abundantly smudged with fingerprints from texting and all other kinds of air contaminants and debris during a normal daily usage These types of soilings arent easily removed but with a invisible glass shield they can be removed from the screen easier and the brilliance can be returned to the viewing area much better than if the shield werent present ,positive
I bought this thinking it was the new glass protecter for the S7 It isnt So far ZAGG doesnt make a glass screen protecter for this device The one that they did have which I bought doesnt adhere around the perimeter of the phone It does provide protection but wont look right and will get dirt and small particles under the screen I would suggest you get another kind that fits ,positive
This screen protector forms a halo around it It appears as if it was lifted and after a while it started cracking from one side and then from another side Given that they come with a warranty I will be contacting ZAGG to get a replacement but I would give it some time in oder for them to fix this issue I wouldnt recommend anyone to buy it right now Give it some time until ZAGG fixes this problem ,negative
I have always liked Zagg screen protectors but the fit on the Galaxy S7 leaves a little halo on the edges because of the phone design Dirt and lint from my pockets have started to collect under the sides making it a short lived protector if that kind of thing bothers you The durability on the other hand is fantastic the glass screen protectors make me feel much more at ease about accidents ,positive
I always get Zagg screen protectors for my phones as they usually dont disappoint However this one could definitely be better Theres a Halo around the edges of my screen protector due to the S7s slight curve near the edges I have a regular S7 and not a S7 Edge and there is still a slight curve on the sides of the regular S7 With the halo showing dirt will build up under the screen protector ,negative
This item is horrible Zagg and Bestbuy sell an item THEY KNOW isnt going to fit the phone Why this item hasnt been taken off the selling floor is beyond me AFTER you buy it they tell you it doesnt fit the phone rightwell if you know that then get rid of it My cover cracked days after getting it because the cover is flat and the phone is slightly curved at the edges ,negative
I am a huge fan of Zagg shields for most every phone Ive ever owned Unfortunately it does not fit the S7 properly Due to the slight curvature of the S7 screen the screen protector does not adhere solidly around the edges and leaves what they call a halo effect This effect really bothers me and its hard because it leaves a different color than the rest of the screen protector ,negative
Ive used Zagg products for years and cant say enough good about them Their support and lifetime replacement policy is outstanding If the protective cover cracks gets scratched etc you go online or call and they ship a replacement always had mine within 3 days for only the minimal shipping cost Put the new one on and send them back the damaged one in the provided postage paid envelope ,positive
Liked the touch and feel of the glass shield protector however with the S7 not the edge the edge of the screen is still slightly beveled This protector doesnt account for that design and per best buy personnel a known issue Eventually returned the item as there was a halo effect around the perimeter which eventually collected pocket lint and obscured some of the viewing screen ,negative
We didnt notice it at first but after using the glass shield for a while we noticed there was a sensitivity issue when trying to use certain numbers or letters on the keyboard while texting This really bothers me bc I consider myself to text fairly fast and the issues causes me to have to go back and correct a lot before actually sending the text ,negative
Love the glass screen its worth paying Best Buy a few dollars extra to put it on properly my screen is clean and smooth definitely worth the money to protect my screen too many people have broken their screens just make sure you register your screen we use the OtterBox case and put the glass screen on it best protection no problems can hear clearly its wonderful definitely highly recommend ,positive
I dont care about the lifetime warranty Im more worried about the fact that it does not sit flush on the left and right side like others have stated Big 40 disappointment I bought Zagg instead of a cheap Amazon generic for a reason and I was let down ,negative
It was easy to put on and it has stayed on with no issues It is very clear and cleans up easy with a microfiber cloth The only thing that I didnt like is that there is a space around the edge of itOn both the right and left sides there is a 38 or so area where the protector is not on the phone which leaves a noticeable strip on both sides Other than that it has worked good ,positive
The shield itself is great but my daughter broker hers less than a week afterwardyou have to go on line enter the warranty info mail the broken on it you remove it yourself send for shipping and handling and then about a week later it shows up in the mail Then you can install it yourself or go back to the store where the will install it for free Wheeeeeee what a deal ,positive
This screen protector does not fit correctly on the galaxy s7 The screen edge on the galaxy phone is curved just enough to leave a noticable bubble around the entire edge of the phone It does not adhere to the phone completely It has been installed for a couple weeks now and the bubbles have not gone away I would not recommend purchasing this screen protector ,positive
I can honestly say that this product is worth the money I have put the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector on all of our phones I know from experience that they work after accidently dropping my phone the shield cracked which is replaced for free when you reach out to the company but it saved my phone and now that we have to lease phones the Zagg protector is a must ,positive
I had it on my S5 and it was great so I decided to put it on my S7 and it doesnt sit flush on the sides I dont like how it looks but I have kids so what can I do Plus Im not sure its the phone or the shield but my buttons are less sensitive to the touch So I would recommend if you dont mind it not sitting flush and having kids but if your not going to drop your phone dont get it ,positive
Had it installed for two weeks and its already saved the phone My wife dropped her phone and the screen protector took the hit and broke instead of the screen The lifetime warranty is a complete pain in the behind though Almost as cheap to go buy a new protector after all the shipping Ive definitely seen less expensive options out there Still better than 599 for a new phone though ,negative
Had this product installed when I upgraded my phone It didnt seal all the way to the edge of the screen I was told to register for the warranty and then go thru the company to have it replaced for free Have tried a second one with the same issue Not really a free replacement if I have to pay 599 shipping each time Haven ’ t decided if Ill try one more or just go my money back ,positive
They should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this It doesnt fit the slightly rounded screen of the S7 and I guarantee you they dont have one that fits the edge Within 24 hours the edge of my screen protector was cracked Zaggs fix to this problem was to send me a cheap screen protector They have no idea when the screen protector that fits the phone properly will be released ,negative
This is the best protection for a phone ever I had one on my previous phone I dropped the phone one night while I was getting our of my car It hit the ground face down I couldnt see it so I ended up stepping on it and slide on it across the concrete My actual screen was saved The shield had to be replaced but all I had to pay was SH since I registered my product Super pleased ,positive
The original shield protected my phone when it fell on concrete It cracked and the company offers a lifetime replacement I bought this to put on my phone while waiting to get the replacement shield It came fast and should I break it again I will have one to put right on while getting another replacement Best Buy put it on my phone for me too ,negative
Very disappointed Previous protector lasted over 2 years with barely a scratch Within 1 week this had a sizeable crack across one corner from picking it up by the corner Will be taking advantage of the replacement program Hopefully that will go smoothly and next one well be better as these are rather expensive to have to deal with poor quality My husbands has been good so far ,negative
This Screen Protector cracked only 3 after I purchased the item and it cost 6 or 7 dollars to ship the replacement and then you have to pay to ship the bad one back The last one I got took nearly 18 months to crack when they crack they are usually hard to see unless they are in just the right light even with a cracked screen protector you are still able to do almost everything ,negative
This is the best screen protector if you are a phone dropper With young kids around my phone and accidents happen I have never had a cracked screen The glass cracks if it hits right but you just peel it off and replace it and the actual phone screen underneath is fine I highly recommend this product ,positive
Best Buy charges 8 to place it on my phone SeriouslyPlaced it on my brand new phone Even though they used the rubbersilicone squeegee it still has air bubbles under it in several places Its already chipped on the edge Less than a month oldWorst screen protector Ive purchased and at least double the price of any Ive ever purchased Im not pleased at all ,positive
The salesmen did mention and show me the fit of the Zagg glass on the S7 and while it does not fit flat against the display I am hoping that it does not affect wear although it is a reason for concern I only purchased it 4 days ago so no issues as of yet I was not offered an alternative so I went with it hoping for the best as I was very happy with the Zagg glass for my S5 ,negative
Been using these for years and have broken two of them but the screen is perfectly fine Saves me 110 repair costs every time I break one Their offer of sending you a replacement cover if it breaks is incredible For cost of shipping and handing you get a brand new one Be sure to ask BB to price match as you will find it cheaper elsewhere But BB will match it ,positive
Like everyone else said I purchased this today after getting my phone early from ATT and the glass doesnt fit the phone It looks and feels great in the middle but there is definitely a halo around the edge of the phone due to the curved edge on the S7 ,positive
We are longtime zagg buyers but for some reason which apparently is common the glass screen for the galaxy s7 does not fit very well The edges do not lay flat on both sides the edges are sligtly lifted up and not completely on the phone Otherwise I love using the zagg glass screen protector but I think samsung tweaked the phone a little too much with a curve ,positive
The screen protector works as expected and advertised not only does it protect but it seems to to enhance the screen color and clarity My only challenge was getting a perfectly clean screen so the protector went on without specs on the screen I have 2 specs of dust on my screen that I can not see when the phone is on but you can tell its there was a black screen ,positive
This Glass Screen Protector has saved me several times I happened to enter and see a customers broken phone A Rep pulled the top piece off and the phone was UNBROKEN Within a few weeks I dropped my phone and saw cracks everywhere After pulling off the protector MY phone was perfect NOT ONE Crack I immediately went and replaced the shield I will not be without one ,negative
Good cover easy application In my opinion SUPER expensive but was convenient to get it right at the store versus online If youre looking to save cash think ahead and order ahead But in this case Id say you get what you pay for I use a case that doesnt have a screen protector but no screen problems from normal use or dropping here and there thanks to this product ,positive
All was well until the screen protector wouldnt set properly I expected a lot from this especially because it was so pricey and was recommended by a friend I did everything exactly as the instructions said The protector just doesnt fit the phone c ,positive
At first I was told that the edges would settle to the curvature of the screen That did not happen With a little checking I found out that zagg for whatever reason was not aware of precise specs for the S7 phone Zagg has announced a new curved screen for the S7 on their website to be available soon but they dont know exactly when ,positive
This is my second screen protector first replaced free by Best Buy for same reason pulling sway from the screen on all 4 corners now up the sides I have a case on my phone also I have searched cant find any other screen protectors for the S7 Edge DO NOT PURCHASE YOU DO NOT GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR EVEN THE SCEOND TIME AROUND ,positive
At worst the screen protector has already cracked within about 2 weeks time from light pressure on the phone between being in my pocket or lightly rolled over on in bed which ends up getting moved to the night table after that realization its meh at best and I was upsold on it and didnt realize it till I left the store as the case I bought had a screen protector in it ,negative
I would never buy a phone again with one of these screen protectors I had my new S7 for two weeks and dropped it one time the case I had didnt help at all the screen protector cracked but the phone screen was unharmed I took it to a Zagg kiosk all the mall and they changed it out in just minutes No question asked Although it cost me me 1600 to get the new one installed ,negative
Best Buy installed the shield for me Zagg has a great warranty which sells my use The shield looks good Went on very well Only negative thing that may or may not be the shield seems like the screen may not be quite as sensitive to swipes as the older flexible film It may be just me but that is the only concern I would have Swipes work just not always on the first time ,positive
I was disappointed in this screen cover It cracked in two places before I had it for two weeks Best Buy said they were getting a lot of the covers in that were warped which in turn caused cracking After contacting Zagg they are sending a new one but wanted to charge a 599 shipping fee I talked them into waving it this time since it was a defective screen cover ,negative
Not crazy about how the screen protector fits the screenhas a halo effect all on both sides and makes the screen less sensitiveThe first one I had cracked on the edgethe one the store tried to n put on my husband phone cracked as they were putting it onNot very happy with the over all look and use of the protector I would not buy this again ,negative
This is my second time purchasing this product it totally protected my screen when my kid dropped phone on the bus and I didnt want to wait for mail shipment so I repurchased itThe cover cracked as if it was glass and my child was scared to show me phone when he came home but all was well screen protector worked as advertised ,negative
Top right corner of shield separated from screen surface on 1st install by Best Buy associate I returned for credit under 14day warranty and another BB associate installed 2nd one which is now having the same problem but in both top corners where it curves around the center cutout Twice makes me think it is defective design Plan to consult BB again ,negative
With this installed on an S7 you can not use anything near the edge of the screen due to the fact that it doesnt conform to the slight curve of the phones edges No I dont have the curve version of the phoneI dont usually do negative reviews but this product does not work for the phone it is sold for ,negative
I have had Zagg screen protectors on my phones in the past It is a great product However though it was listed to fit my Samsung it was too wide and hung slightly over the edges This was not just one screen protector but the same for the other two that I bought for the other new phones that I bought Best buy was willing to take all 3 back if I was disatisfied ,positive
The screen protector does what it is supposed to do HOwever on the Samsung S7 it does not fit the edges of the phone well and does not adhere well This is not the EDGE phone but the regular phone There is also a charge to ship it and to install it Total cost is about 13 to replace the class screen Zagg customer service is GREAT however ,positive
40 for the screen protector and another 8 to have it installed seemed a bit high When other places will put the screen on for free But in the long run its a good investment on a 700 phone It does not effect using the phone and you cant even tell its there My only suggestion would be for the screen to attach on the edges Dirt gets trapped there easily ,positive
Ive had zagg glass protectors before and they worked great though I had undesirable warranty customer service from zagg but they are not for the S7s curved screen I was warned about the halo effect and that the edges might crack a bit but that happened after Id had it 2 days and had not dropped it I ended up with cracks all across my screen with no origin points ,negative
I have not had any problems with the screen protector but had I read the reviews I would have bought a different one The S7 basic model has a slight curve on the edge of the screen This glass screen protector is completely flat and does not cover the curved edges I bought this instore and did not think to read online reviews while shopping ,negative
I have had these on my last 2 phones and they fit really well and did an amazing job at protecting the screen I upgraded all of our phones to S7s and have had to replace 3 of these already in just over 1 month They dont fit well where the edges on either side of the phone dont actually sit against the screen Pretty poor for the S7unfortunate ,positive
Work outside so was looking for more protection for my screen Had one with the last phone and wanted to continue that One suggestion if you buy the Otter protective case for your phone there is also a screen protector in the box so you dont have to buy a separate one like this This screen protector is good but just sayin ,positive
Zagg makes great screen protectors and I used theirs on my S5 for 2 years But somehow with the new design of S7 the curved edges etc the screen protector gives a very poor tactile experience I was doubting the quality of the phone but realized that it was the screen protector which was messing up my interactions rather than the phone itself ,negative
4 mm halo around the entire screen had the sales associate apply and she tried 2 and they were both the same seriously annoying because it was the same with the s6 until they recut the glass after customer complaints why did I assume that the s6 illfitting screen was an isolated error would leave no star if I could ,negative
I bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S7 phone I did NOT buy the Galaxy S7 Edge However the new S7 screens are still slightly curved at the edges Zagg did not compensate for the slight imperceptible curvature of the new phone screens As a result the edges of the Invisibleshield Glass do not adhere to the screen Dont buy until they fix the problem ,negative
this shield does not fit properly it is a good enough protector to use until zagg comes out with a newer one that fit the screen better it seems that the new galaxy s7 phones have a bit of a lift on the edges and this glass protector does not conform to the lift per a zagg rep the new shields coming out soon should be able to conform better to the phones ,positive
This is actually the second GlassShield Ive purchased for the same phone since it was purchased about 8 months ago I had radiating cracks in two to three spots on the shield and decided to replace it before it got worse However it did its job in that the actual glass on the phone screen is still pristine Hoping this second one lasts a little longer ,negative
I am a dropper I drop my phone at least once a week I put this screen saver on when I purchased my phone and it protected the screen as it said it would The glass protector cracked in several places instead of the actual phone screen cracking Still worked when cracked ,negative
I got this and Im not sure if it was a good purchase I may be saving my screen from scratches but the sides of the protective layer doesnt reach all of the screen and there are cracks in it I now have to research on how to get it replaced Not even a full year and Im not that much of a hard user of my phone ,negative
Covers most of the screen side of the phone and protects it from damage Dropped my phone once and the protector cracked slightly but the phone is fine Has a border that looks like the protector isnt making contact with the screen Not sure if its suposed to do this it all the way around Looks weird But it still provides protections so i deal with it ,negative
The thin glass does cove the whole are of the phone However as the screen of the Galaxy S7 has a slight curve on the edges the glass cover does not bend with it As a result the edges of the screen are not glue to the glass When the screen is on it makes no difference But you can see it when the screen is off Still it does protect your phone ,positive
I had this product on my Galaxy S4 and it worked great On my s7 It feels like my touch response is impeded The touch is not responsive without multiple tapping Now my phone just completed an update and this issue may be resolved Quite frankly I have not had the opportunity to test it All in all however it does a good job of protecting the screen ,positive
The screen protector is better than other Zagg products I have had The glass is slick and feels like the screen on the phone itself I got the S7 when it first came out and this screen protector did not seal along the sides of the phone where it was slightly curved I was concerned about the screen protector coming off It has not and I have had it over 2 months ,positive
This protector does its job and save the screen from small scratches although it does not fit the S7 like it should so the Halo effect is a serious issue I went through more screen protectors for this phone than ever before Finally got upset enough i just got tired of wasting money on it I traded the phone in on the new Note8 ,negative
Since the sides of my Samsung Galaxy S7 curve on the sides I had to return this glass screen protector for a plastic one Im very disappointed as I know that the glass screen covers protect much better but you cant curve glass I gave it a high review because the brand is great and my wife was able to get a glass protector for her screen on her phone ,positive
This is a life saver This is my 2nd time purchasing this item I would NOT or NEVER purchase anything else except this Samsung Protector It has protected my phone from a fall from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor My phone landed on cement outside and phone DID NOT CRACK Only the protector crack Love love this screen protector ,negative
I do not own the curved S7 but the edges are still slightly curved The glass sits above the edge so there has been dirt and other little things collecting ever since Also dropped my phone day one and the glass protector cracked I know thats the point but Ive never had any type of phone protection break on me so easily ,negative
This glass protector fits the screen perfectly and is case friendly I use it with my Otterbox Commuter series case and there are no issues Clarity is excellent and it really doesnt hold smudges so its really easy to clean I have used cheaper ones on previous phones and there is definitely a positive difference with this For me was well worth the money ,positive
Best Buy price matched and glad they did Easy to put on and sensativity is nice Product breaks easy with short fall to carpet several times They get you for 10 dollars everytime you replace I have had better break quality with cheaper glasses Not worth it ,positive
Doesnt fit properly Poorly mfg Tried 6 different covers to no avail Spoke to factory todaypossibly a new version will be available by year end Or so zagg company said Best Buy was well aware of the problem but was not able to do anything about it It would be great if the manufacturing company who made the incorrect design fixed the problem sooner ,positive
The screen protector does not adhere to the left and right edges of my screen It has already broken along the edges in three places within a month It has probably protected my screen which is why I gave it 2 stars It is still under warranty so Ill either get a replacement or refund but it should work better than it has ,positive
I needed a screen protector for my S7 and this one was the best one out at the time It works fine but the only issue I have with it is that it does not completely cover the screen on the phone Theres still like a quarter of an inch of the screen still exposed Supposedly Zagg has released another screen protector that covers the entire phone now though ,positive
Ive had my own Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S6 for two years and its great When it came time to upgrade my wifes phone the clear choice was the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7These do a GREAT job protecting the screen and are very sensitive to the touchCharlie Seymour Jr ,positive
It sells itself My concern is the employees Instead of the employees talking to each its more professional to greet every customer and not turn their backs and continue their conversation Please approach the customer and not what has happened last or going to happen that day Thank you ,negative
Ive never bought a glass screen so i thought it would be neat to try this time I like it but the when applying for the first time it small air pockets kept creeping up on both sides of the phone As i pressed firmly around the edges to seal a small crack appeared For the most part I like it with an additional hard case as extra protection ,positive
Okay youre going to buy local buy a Zagg invisishield obviously because they our local company that make a good product usually With the S7 I hate to say it the edges dont sit down and you have whats called haloing youll never get a good fit youll constantly get dirt and grime and hair underneath it and you will pull it off just get the HDX ,negative
The galaxy s7 was designed with a beveled screen and this protector doesnt fit well The edges dont seal allowing dust and particles to collect around the sides Its also interferes with the touch features at the edge of the screen due to the poor design However it still does the job of protecting the screen and the company does guarantee their product ,negative
As usual Zagg doesnt disappoint I almost always go with Zagg or Spiegen This time I needed something quick and didnt want to wait for an order to come in for Spiegen so went with Zagg Instructions are clear and they include everything you need to put the screen protector on right away Its held up so far through a couple bangs Top quality here ,positive
It was easy to attach to the phone which I really liked but it doesnt stick very well in the upper corners and is coming off a little more each day I dont remember dropping my phone but there is a chip in the screen protector and not the actual phone screen so it seemed to do the job I wouldve rated it higher if it adhered to the phone better ,positive
Ive been buying ZAGG screen protectors since 2012 and this is the only time Ive been disappointedThe glass protector doesnt fit the phone correctly and cracks around the edges Originally I thought it was a one time problem and used ZAGGs lifetime warranty I got a replacement and the same cracks happened within a few days ,negative
This thing has a way better feel than other screen protectors It is glass and well feels like glass Install was a breeze Took me a couple tries to get it centered Got ta be really careful if you peel it up to re center Its glass and will break Great product for the about the same price as other protectors And a warranty ,positive
Maybe its just me but the last 2 Ive bought have broke very quickly I usually never have that problem Although it is a new phone so I suppose it could be the design of the phone But the point of the protector is to protect the actual phone screen and it definitely does that I have not had a phone screen ever crack so thats great ,negative
The glass covers the viewable area of the screen however the S7 screen curves slightly on the edges and the Zagg does not seat well as it is flat and does not match the curve of the screen The gap is easily visible and appears that you didnt smooth out the screen protector on the edge Not attractive Great product great warranty poor fitment ,positive
My son got the galaxy 7 for his birthday two weeks ago I immediately added an otter box case and a Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector because I know Well the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector already has a crack but the phone screen is completely fine Thank you Zagg for saving the screen on a brand new Galaxy 7 ,negative
Ive had a smartphone for 8 years and managed to never break the screen When I purchased my new phone six weeks ago this was the protector the sales rep suggested Given my history I almost didnt buy it Last week I dropped my phone in a parking lot and the protector shattered but NOT the screen on my phone I love this product ,negative
Had the protection on my phone and phone in a mophie case dropped it and the screen cracked but not the screen protector due to the angle of the hit the case should have protected it the protector was replaced by Zagg for about 7 which was about 12 of the sale price I paid or about 14 normal price the replacement process was easy ,positive
Im very familiar with Zagg products and so I didnt bother reading any reviews of this product BIG MISTAKE This product does not fit the Galaxy S7 It was not made to the dimensions of the screen and therefore will not protect your phone as it should It will not adhere to any of the edges and will make parts of your screen difficult to interact with ,negative
Smooth clear and a perfect fit Cant believe the sharpness of my screen I am always amazed at how great my screen looks I am a first time glass screen protector user and cant believe that for years I dealt with bubbles and marks on my film screen protectors If youve never used one before this is a must I am a firm believer of Zagg products ,positive
The Screen Protector doesnt fully seal along the edges Which creates a halo along the edges and within 4 days you notice dust inside and it starts to peel off I registered the product with Zagg and they shipped a cheaper version wasnt glass but it covered my whole screen with no problem Pretty much 40 dollars down the drain ,negative
I bought this screen protector and a day later it already had a crack in it Didnt drop my phone or anything as i didnt have a casd on it at the time and my phone had no scratches so i exchanged for a new one and once i took it out of the box i noticed it was cracked in half Wouldnt waste my money again on this screen protector or brand ,negative
Hard to review since the glass screen protector cracked like a dinged windshield unexpectedly I am not aware of dropping it or hitting it with a sharp object Whatever happened the phone itself is still sound which is the purpose of the screen protector It was expensive Thank goodness the geeks said I didnt need to worry about replacing it now ,negative
The first day of owning my Samsung Galaxy S7 it slid off the desk hitting the keyboard shelf on the way down I picked it up and my heart stopped There was what looked like chip on the edge of the screen Closer examination showed it was the screen protector that had taken the damage So glad they installed it instore at Best Buy ,positive
The Zagg Invisible Glass Screen Protector provides excellent screen protection for our cell phones Weve used them on 3 different phone styles and each style has a perfect fit Weve also had to replace a couple of the screens and had NO issues with the company The screens were replaced quickly and simply A terrific product ,positive
I have had the screen protector on my phone for a little over a month and there is already a small nick in it Hasnt been dropped at all I do sometimes have it in my purse with my wallet keys etc Itsr eally small can barely see it I noticed because I felt something rough on the screen while wiping it off Going to call about the warranty ,negative
If you are getting a new phone get one of these immediately You will regret not buying one if you drop the phone often which is inevitable Works great so far and I have dropped it several times No cracks or breaks so far Note I am also using a smaller otterbox case Both items coupled together act as a great deterrent to breaks ,negative
Bought this on recommendation of Best Buy phone seller guy It has taken a beating and has protected my new phone very well It also has fantastic rodent resistance as my guinea pig was nibbling on it and did not damage it It does have dust around the edges between the shield and the screen presumably because the screen curves slightly ,negative
I bought this screen protection for my Galaxy 7 The fit had the edges exposed and the screen would pull off the glass of the phone whenever it dragged across anything or my fingers hit the exposed edge The protector might work with certain protective cases but not with the one I use I had so many problems I returned the screen protector ,positive
Good screenight protector I like that theres a lifetime warranty on the product Ive only had it for 3 weeks and theres a small crack in the corner already even though I havent dropped my phone And sometimes its hard to type on the ends of the screen as it doesnt stick closely to the screen Overall a good purchase and Id buy it again ,negative
Zang makes a good screen protector with a lifetime warranty The only con to this would be if you put your keys or change in the same pocket as your phone If you do you will get cracks in the glass screen protector but better there than in your phone screen They are very good about sending you a new one but you do have to pay shipping ,positive
i like ZAGGs glass screen protectors i have one on my phone and it works quite well and if it everr breaks they will send you a new one my only complaint is that i have to pay 6 shipping whenever that happens and thats about the price that i could pay for a different companies glass screen protector ,positive
Zagg used to be the go to for screen protectors Same yourself the headache and the money and dont buy this tempered glass you will have a halo around the glass because it does not touch the screen The screen curves before the edge of the phone Do you research and dont listen to the sales associate Buy a film screen protector instead ,negative
Glass was to rigid The sides would not stay down I tried to return to best buy they would not deal with it because it was open Called manufacturers they did not hesitate to replace it they gave me several options on how to replace the product I have no problem dealing with the manufacturer at all they were great ,negative
I dont know how anyone could give this product better than a 1 star It just doesnt fit and Zagg acts like it is suppose to hover over the edges of the phone where dust can get underneath it or it can snag on clothing One of the poorest products I have ever seen from a normally very good company Absolutely terrible product ,negative
Bought this vs the privacy screen because I care more about a broken screen over people judging my pinterest Good product thus far it has done its job Its basically the same clarity you get from the original screen so I dont have to turn my brightness all the way up or block a glare A little pricey but saves me in the long run I guess ,negative
This is the second one of these that Ive purchased and the first one was great I had this one for all of 7 days before cracking it Thats my fault of course for dropping it but my old one lasted over a year before cracking so I was a little disappointed Comes with a warranty but Im too lazy to go through those steps ,negative
These products are well worth the money They have protected my phone on many occasions I just put a new one on my phone and within 2 days unfortunately I dropped my phone again So off to the store to get a new one These things are just amazing ,positive
I have 3 phones two of which are my kids My oldest is not what you would call gentle with her technology Every screen shes had shes managed to bust pretty much no matter what This phone is the exception because while the shield is cracked and chipped you can clearly see the device screen underneath is still intact ,positive
This item does not fit the S7 screen well at the edges even when perfectly installed A call to ZAGG revealed that they know this will not lie perfectly on the S7 surface but that they are working on an update that will fit better This begs the question of why they and Best Buy are selling it Their answer its better than nothing Boooo ,positive
I had the HD Invisible shield on my other phone for 2 years and had no issues I heard good things about the glass shield so decided to upgrade with my phone purchase Within a week there is a crack down the entire shieldI gave it 4 stars as Im not sure if this was a product defect or when it was installed by the store associate ,negative
So I did not know that while this says that it is for the S7 it does not fit correctly The screen is proportionate and everything except it tends to flex up around the edges of the screen I was later told that it is the way the S7 is designed and the plastic protectors work better than the glass ,positive
Bought this screen protector for my wife Doesnt even lay flat on the edges It also cracked during the application process Im glad that I only lost my best buy points to purchase it The only reason for the lifetime warranty is it is way overpriced to begin Buy any less expensive screen protector other than this piece of junk ,negative
This protector gets the job done but it does not go edge to edge designed for a cover My cover does not line up with the glass protector so there is an area around the phone that is not sealed and dirt gets under it The glass protector was even placed by the Best Buy employee and she used the wipe cleaner first ,negative
It does not fit on the screen properly There is a slight curve on the S7 and this screen protector lay flat on the screen leaving a raised edge of the glass protector As i tried to push it down more to make a seal the glass cracked However Zagg customer service is great Just do not waste your time with this specific model ,negative
I had a member of the Geek Squad apply this for me the day I upgraded to a Galaxy S7 and she did an amazing job The glass itself makes your finger feel like its swiping air and honestly feels smoother than the screen on some of my unprotected devices even an iPad And you cant beat the warranty on it A good investment to be sure ,positive
I have a black iPhone 6 The edges do not stick to the phone It is very frustrating and the only reason I kept it is I got such a good deal on it I would not recommend this Even the employee said after she had applied it that this shield typically doesnt work with the black iPhone 6 Thanks for the heads up after applying it ,positive
I am pretty active and drop my phone at times Nice to know that I can get something to help insure that when I do drop my phone that it will be protected to some degree These things are not cheap so I feel it is acting responsible to protect an investment ,positive
It does protect the screen however it does not fit properly around the edgesI had mine installed at Best Buy and within one week the edges have cracks I dont drop my phone or abuse it at all so that should not have happened It is a new phone model and they still have some work to do in getting the proper screen protector for it ,positive
I was skeptical of purchasing a glass cover the sales folks talked me into the added benefits of it and I have to say I love it Like the way it is easier to do the swipe function with it easier to keep clean and overall nicer appearance And greater protections I would recommend this as an option over the other screen protectors ,positive
I guess the way the S7 is shaped doesnt allow the the screen cover to lay flat not terrible unless youre a little neurotic Debris can get stuck to the perimeter but it is what it is I guess So far I have dropped my phone a couple time and the screen has remained in tact despite the body of the phone cracking under the case ,negative
I was not sold on getting a glass cover but was convinced of the value by the sales person She showed me her phone and how it looked and the value for protection I must say I am now a fan It is easier to use the swipe function and the phone screen is more readable with the glass cover Appreciate the advice from staff member ,positive
It protects my screen okay but you have to live with cracks and nicks It is easy to cause damage I am a person who has never cracked my screen so seeing dents and cracks on my protector screen was scary I am going with another brand even though it has a warranty I dont want to go thru the hassle over and over again ,negative
I purchased this and the install from my local best buy store A couple of days and there were already hairline fractures in the screen protector and the edges are bubbling up Ive not even dropped the phone or been hard on it Im not sure if the product is defective or if it was placed on incorrectly but its very frustrating ,negative
Zagg really stands behind their products and I would never consider any other screen protector They offer a lifetime warranty you can replace it as many times as you need to with and with Powerhouse like the Samsung S7 you need this to protect the screen Perfect reliability this is a musthave ,positive
This is a high quality item Comes with all you need to install easily and you can feel the thickness and quality vs other competitive products It is more expensive than others but in this case the quality does support the extra costsso it is a good value considering it will last twice as long as most other protectors ,positive
Several reviews commented that the screen easily cracked Well mine arrived from Best Buy SHATTERED When I called customer service and explained this the man paused and then said So you are saying it is damaged I couldnt deal Will be returning to a local store Absolutely disappointed with my entire experience ,negative
I purchased this screen protector with a new phone and it was installed by Best Buy Mobile After installation I noticed it did not adhere to the edges of the screen glass Due to a slight curvature on the outer edges the screen on the Galaxy S7 the protector would not seat and could easily be removed I took this protector back ,negative
Clearest screen protector Ive had no scuffs so far and crystal clear Little on the pricey side but if it holds up in the long run well worth it Now if only Otter Box would come with these I wouldnt have had to punch out the junky plastic screen cover and replace it with this ,negative
I have the regular Galaxy S7 and this screen protector does not contour to the the shape of the screen The edges of this screen have a slight curve to them not as much as the edge but enough so that the edges of the screen protector do not lay flat I have owned a Galaxy S5 with the glass Zagg protector and didnt have this problem ,negative
The glass screen protector does not curve to fit the screen of the samsung galaxy s7 and therefore the glass sticks up and collects dust and dirt underneath it Its a shame because I really like zaggs shields and they work really really well when they actually fit the intended product in the right way ,positive
TamiJosh and Carlos are fantastic to work with beforeduring and after the sale Carlos has helped us many times at the Samsung counter with other Samsung products They are the reason we switched to Best Buy and Verizon from another carrier for two new phones and a tablet Its like being with family as they are so friendly ,positive
New Galaxy S8 phone requires a new Zagg glass screen protector I dont use any other type and have never had a phone screen shatter although I have been through quite a few Zagg protectors I drop my phone a lot I would have given it 5 stars but the S8 is not as touch sensitive with this new protector on ,negative
I let the sales person talk me into my first glass cover for the Galaxy S7 Put it on and immediately noticed it has about a quarter inch around the edge of the screen that the protector does not lay flat against Even worse it interferes with touch screen operation around edges Not happy at all Best Buy better give me a refund ,positive
Cracked the screen within 6 days of getting phone I was originally told there was a lifetime warranty but was never told I needed to contact manufacturer for product then bring that into the store to be installed Im going on my thirst screen in less then 1 month I guess it does its job since my phone screen isnt broken ,negative
This wasnt my first time buying these screen protectors but this time I was not too impressed As I was applying the screen protector it cracked on the bottom just as I applied it But otherwise it does do its job I have not had a cracked screen at all just the protector has taken the scratches and cracks ,negative
All zagg glass screens are awesome Only problem is that new phones are all curving the edges of the screens at the edge When applying this protector to the s7 it leaves a halo around the edge where the protector doesnt touch the screen This area then collects dust and makes the outter most edge of my phone unusable ,negative
Happy with the protection it provides and the life time replacement warranty Although you have to get it from Zagg Best Buy will install the replacement for free if you paid for installation when you purchased it Hate the beveled edges although it looks cool it can make it more difficult to type on the keys near the edges ,positive
I encouraged my wife to install this on her new phone because she is notorious for damaging phones 3 days after installing the shield she dropped her phone and shattered this protector I feel this saved her screen from shattering I have always used Invisible Shield products and loved them all Worth every penny ,negative
Applied the screen protector on the phones screen as directed in instructions Bubble appeared and couldnt smooth it out A week later my phone dropped on the ground one time and screen protector cracked immediately Under warranty I went to website to get a replacement and had to pay for shipping and handling for new one ,negative
This Zagg screen protector seems to do its job of protecting the phones screen but it is not very resilient at all Within 2 weeks there are 2 separate areas that have already cracked I will be making a claim against the lifetime warranty so after that I may add a star or deduct another depending on how that goes ,negative
I bought this to replace the one on my phone that shattered Protected the phone However learned the hard way after installation that warranty replacement must be done through the company website So I lost money on this one not BBs fault ,negative
Ive used Zagg covers on my phones for several years They are constantly upgrading and improving their productsThe nice thing about the glass shield is that it has a much nicer feel to the touch Many screen protectors dont give the same touch sensation as the actual screen These feel like the screen I like that ,positive
Ive been through two InvisibleShield Glass protectors for the Galaxy S7 The shield does not adhere to the entire screen Along both sides of the screen there is a 18 gap where the shield remains off of the screen Within a week the shield cracks along this gap ,negative
The product was not designed properly for the Galaxy S7 The installer tried three different covers and they all did the same thing and that was for my phone He also tried twice on my husbands and got the same result Ive dropped my phone twice by accident and now my screen is shattered in three places ,positive
This cell phone shield for the screen is subpar in that it does not go completely to the edge and secure there is an air gap all around the face of the screen so it isnt completely sealedit can still do the job as long as the center holds its placebut it is better than nothing ,positive
It did not fit my Galaxy S7 and dust was collecting on the areas that did not fitwhen I took my phone back due to other problems with the phone I asked about the size and fitofthe screen and I was told he didnt know why it didnt fit and replaced it with a different HD screen that fit betterwaste of money ,negative
Im a firm believer in Zagg products Ive been using them for years This particular product is not well designed Its not curved and makes it hard to use the edges on the touchscreen Its a shame Best Buy even sells this product I hope I can return this product Ill order from Zagg directly the next time ,negative
I just bought my new phone and screen protector a month ago Only after 3 weeks I noticed the side of my protector screen had a chip in it There was no trauma done to the screen or phone to cause this so Im not sure what caused it to happen Ive never had an issue with Zagg so Im bummed this one broke so quick ,negative
Purchased this after recommendation from a Best Buy employee when returning the HD plastic Invisible Shield I feel that my screen is more secure with the glass version versus the plastic The only drawback is that it leaves a line going down both sides of the protector that looks like a line of dirt that cant be cleaned ,positive
When I had an iPhone I always purchased the Zagg glass for screen protection Tried to do the same when I switched to Samsung Discovered that at least with the S7 the edges of the phone makes it difficult to apply the glass Resulting look is an air bubble that circles the entire phone hence the nickname halo ,negative
I am really disappointed My glass has 2 cracks The 1st one occurred with a slight hit of a TV remote The 2nd crack no where near the 1st just suddenly appeared My phone has not been dropped or mishandled If anything buy the invisible shield I have never cracked the glass on any phone I have ever owned ,negative
I LOVE Zagg shields However the BB associate who put on mine left air leaks on the side Where the air bubbles are it has cracked already after limited use I registered my shield so Ill only have to pay shipping for another but its still a little frustrating Make sure the shield is put on properly ,negative
This ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 did not fit the S7 It doesnt curve at the edges and cracked the day after I installed the protector I would give it a 0 Do not waste your money on this item I called Zagg and they recommended S7 users install the acrylic protector ,negative
This product works perfectly I had it for about 2 days dropped my phone the glass cracked but the phone was fine I sent it in for replacement with 6 shipping they sent a new one and that lasted 4 days before the same thing happenedphone still fine They will keep shipping new ones for 6 foreverperfect ,positive
Bought this screen saver for my mothers phone she loves it Only issue she had wit was that it wasnt put on correctly and started peeling When she had it in her pocket it peeled and cracked when she sat down She had no issues getting it replaced They send out new one wa return envelope to make it quick and easy ,negative
I researched a lot before choosing this screen protector It had to be the best for my phone Why protect it with anything less I love that this has a lifetime warranty My screen protector has cracked due to my boyfriend mishandling it and I was able to just request another one all I had to pay for was the shipping ,positive
Tempered glass is not cheap but worth to buy It is easy to clean durable and doesnt easily leave finger marks compared to cheap ones I also saw reviews online and people are saying manufacturer are true to their words on warranty If you break it manufacturer will replace it ,positive
I had this put on at the store and the technician did the best he could But the edges of the screen must curve and there is 18 around all edges that is not stuck down I carry my phone in my pocket and there is already lint and dirt under the edges and I have only had it a week ,negative
I bought this for my galaxy s7 Fit is very good and it is wider than other screen protector glass However the edge of protector is weakI think I have little cracking even if I did not have any big drop of my phone Anyway this warranty I believe will be good so they will provide good service ,positive
Doesnt even feel like you have a screen protector installed it is so smooth Ive tried installing these myself and theres nothing worse than trapping lint or an air bubble under that shiny new protector I recommend Geek Squad installation to insure you walk out with a perfectly clean clear screen ,positive
Love my Zagg tempered class screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S7 It looks just like the screen without a protector Really works well I somehow got a chip on the upper corner of the first one I purchased but my phone screen was undamaged I had to replace the broken one Love the way it looks ,positive
Within the first 24 hours I dropped my phone 1 time and in that one time the glass cover got a scratch in it The one I had on my old phone took a beating and barely had a crack in it I am slightly bummed that this one hasnt handled as well It still did its job just bummed it happened in the 24 hour period ,negative
Arrived as described Actual glass was too big for the Galaxy S7 Where the edges bevel on the phone the glass shield stayed raised since it would have to bend to adhere with the phone curves so it never makes a complete seal This caused the glass shield to crack with no virtually no pressure applied ,negative
Zagg non glass screen protectors are great however the glass ones are the worst My phone dropped a short distance ON ITS BACK and the screen protector shattered after only having it a few days My husbands also randomly cracked in his pocket within the first 2 weeks The absolute worst protectors ever ,negative
I was hoping the prior reviews may have just gotten lemons but sadly no the edges never stay down and it will soon become an issue as dust settlesedges raise Save yourself the hassle and use a different model The brand itself however is good which is why I gave it 2 stars prior experience was awesome ,negative
Im sure this type of screen protector works quite well with many phones however due to the S7 having a slightly curved screen it cracks all along the sides and leaves an unsightly halo down both sides as well This protector should not have been marketed for this phone ,positive
First smartphone which I researched over 3 months So happy with it and especially the quality of the camera and battery lifetime Am excited to learn more about the phone after taking a Samsung Workshop from Best Buy which will maximize opportunities for me Cant go wrong worth every penny of the investment ,positive
Works as described It keeps your screen cleaner than the otter box screen but it breaks easy And the replacement warranty is a joke I contacted zagg about replacing my last one It costs 7 to get it with the warranty Really the warranty just says we will sell you another screen protector ,negative
Had BB put one of these on my wifes S7 Works great and is very clear She throws her phone in her purse with about 8 million pounds of other things and so far this has kept the screen from picking up any scratches Tends to smear a little bit with fingerprints andor cosmetics but that is to be expected ,negative
The screen protector worked well though it was a little difficult to get all of the spots out Ive put protectors on many times and this was not the easiest one to use however I would buy it again in the future ,positive
I purchase from Best Buy because the product that they sell the brandsthey make available are the Best Quality the Geek squad technical support and warranties are excellent the personal is knowledgeable helpful and courteous Prices are either competitive or betterBuy Best BuyBestHenry Young ,positive
I paid around 18 for this product put it on my phone as instructed only to be left with these air filled lines at the edges of my phone I applied as much as force as possible to get the air out without any success Took it off and retried only to collect dust and hair on it Waste of money ,negative
I dont like that it only comes with one cover you get one good shot at applying It can be done again not as smooth Comes with great kit to do it though wet cloth and dry cloth to clean first and good steps Havent had it really put to the test for protection yet so far so good ,positive
This was bought for my Samsung Galaxy S7 When applying it I almost had it perfect with no flaws but could not get rid of an annoying bubble in middle of screen Reapplying it caused more screen imperfection issues that were impossible to get rid of I am not using it on my phone as a result ,negative
This screen protector is very clear and not detectable except for the fact that mine has a crack in it Perhaps the protector did its job by protecting the phones screen but it cracked right away after a very gentle bump simply putting the phone down on a table not tossing it or dropping it ,negative
The Zagg glass protector is flat and the Galaxy S7 has curved edges If this sits in a tough case it may be fine If you have a rubber case and tend to put the phone in your pocket the edge will crack Sure it comes with a warranty how useful is it when it will not last two weeks ,positive
This does not fit the S7 properly and leaves what Zagg calls a halo effect around the screen where it will not stick I contacted Zagg customer care and was told they are working on a curved one to fit the phone correctly but customers need to register and pay a 10 upgrade fee Not cool Zagg ,positive
either make the protector smaller or find a way to have it work better the the curvature of the screen around the edges I ended up only having it on my phone for a few weeks before too much gunk got under the edges I pulled it back to try to clean the edges and it cracked in the bottom half Would not recommend ,positive
This is a great screen protector but I did break one within 2 weeks after using it ZAGG was great about replacing it but it did cost 599 for shipping So dont knock your phone off of the counter or drop it very often because you will be requesting a new screen proctor often and the shopping costs will add up ,negative
This screen protector is so much easier to install than the adhesive plastics I will go with a glass cover from now on The downside is that it can still get damaged which happened pretty quickly for me but only on one edge so Im still using it and havent submitted for a replacement under warranty yet ,negative
This is the first time I have used a screen protector Installation was done in store by the Samsung rep It was done before I realized he had even started Invisible and functional After reading the information with the product I am sure I could have easily installed it myself Great Service ,negative
The associate applied the screen protector for me when I purchased my phone When she was done she said that there would be a halo effect around the edges but it would go away in a couple of days It never went away and now it is cracked on the edge On a good note the screen underneath is not cracked ,negative
This is my second screen The first one I had to returned it Didnt last long and my second one its already broken They have a lifetime guarantee but you have to paid shipping and handling and if I continued doing the returning of the product I will be ending paying more than the actual price ,negative
My Review its a good screen protector i had one for my old phone and i dropped my phone and the screen shattered i thought but it was only the screen protector and as i peeled it off my phone screen was fine Only complaint i have is it does not fit the complete phone as my old one did ,negative
If I could give this product no stars I would The screen didnt even completely adhere time the s7 screen Then After a week the corners of at the top of the screen began to Crack and flake offor and cut my ear Soo Thank you zagg Im normally impressed with your product search but not this one ,positive
Cracked easily I was able to get a free replacement I ordered online paying only for shipping It arrived in a timely manner Returned cracked one in their postage paid envelope I recently noticed a chip in the new shield Im not sure if I want to pay for shipping again Next time Ill go back to plastic ,positive
I really like this product I have bought for 4 phones so far You have to pay to get Best Buy to install the first time then they will install any replacements for you for free Zagg stands by their product and I will continue to purchase for future phones I get A must have ,positive
I have always used the other material to protect the display I tried this one because it was recommended The phone slipped out of my wore out holder I had attached to my belt and cracked within the first week Not a good choice if your phone ever falls out of your hand or case ,positive
I bought one for my phone and one for the wifes phone I broke mine I dont know how so I need to go get it replaced Better to break the protector than the screen Still able to use the phone just fine I did think that this would be a bit more durable but I am satisfied with its performance ,positive
I used to have the plastic shield and had no problems with it peeling or scratches I was given the recommendation to try the glass and I do not like it because of how easily it cracks and scratches My screen on my phone is completely undamaged however after 15 years ,negative
I was expecting these glass shields to be much more scratch and crack resistant Scratches much easier than the regular phone screen and cracks much easier too My daughters screen protector was completely cracked within two weeks Glad they have a good warranty But who knows how long the replacement will last ,negative
Ive never been impressed since they started making glass screen protectors that dont cover the edges Within one month of purchasing this there were 4 chips on the edges and a crack starting from one of them I requested a warranty replacement and got the original shield that goes to the edges ,negative
So far seems to protect my scree from dirt and scratches However the edges have still not molded to the screen so there is a bit of a halo effect around the edge Not too big a deal but a bit annoying Been about a month feels like it shouldnt take this long But the screen is protected so Ill put up with it ,negative
Of all the screen protectors I have applied this is absolutely the easiest It literally took just minutes There were initially 2 large bubbles which smoothed right out with very little effort I will be shocked if it ever comes loose around the edges Great product ,negative
I was very surprised by the way it crumbled around the edges so fast I only had it on my phone a couple of months I am very careful when handling my phone Ithe was easy to install I have to get another screen protector dont know if I m going to get the same one Mixed feelings right now ,positive
I usually have a Otterbox on my phone and was talked into trying this product While it is nice that it you cant see it or even feel that its there I already have two cracks in it It does have a lifetime guarantee which Ive already sent off for but Ive only had it 3 weeks Very disappointed ,negative
The screen protector does not cover the whole screen which would be fine if it didnt hang over the slightly curved edges of the Galaxy S7I dont have the S7 Edge The edges became less and less responsive to touch then unusable There are plenty of Glass screen protectors that are similar for under 10 ,negative
On a Galaxy S7 this screen would not seal at the edges about 14 of an inch was raised up and would not stick I had it installed by the Geek Squad guys initially Returned it and they replaced and reinstalled but still had the same problem I exchanged for the plastic version and it worked better for me ,positive
The application of the screen protector is great The more fragile areas are the locations near the speakers and front cameras I wish the glass was a little thicker in these spots My protector broke in these two locations after a week I work in the Automotive repair field ,negative
I like the screen shield overall It was easy to install with the guide tabs My screen responds well through the shield I didnt give 5 stars because there is a distinct line on both sides of the shield that doesnt adhere to my screen I do have a case so the shield isnt peeling off ,positive
I love the Zagg brand and their warrantyI never had a problemeasy to get a new one This is the first time I bought a glass one vs a membrane one There is a halo around the edge of mine and mine cracked within the week Unsure if I am just hard on my phones but my phone was totally protected ,negative
Do not buy This screen protector does not fit The halo effect they describe is in fact the screen protector not appropriately fitting the s7 This screen protector is flat The s7s screen had curved edges The halo is where the screen protector doesnt adhere to the screen ,negative
This is a horrible product I wish the sales clerk would have known that this Glass protector would have broken because of the tapered edge of the glass on my S7 they should not sell this product The old plastic screen protector is the way to go on anything with a beveled peace of glass ,negative
I dropped my phone while outside and of course it completely missed the yard and landed on the driveway Thank goodness the shield did its job and protected the phone Quick replacement of the shield and all is well ,positive
I have purchased multiple Zagg protectors in the past and all have been excellent Their customer service is second to none One of my phones was stolen and after I gave them proof of purchase they sent me another glass free of charge Only paid shipping Cant ask for more than that ,positive
Flat glass that doesnt fit the rounded edge S7 geek squad knows they dont fit but still offer it just to have them returned It leaves about a 14 of both sides of screen not stuck downI returned it and had to go to another store to buy a soft screen protector because BB was sold out ,negative
I love this produce I had one on an older phone and I dropped it and the screen protector shattered It was time to upgrade so took it and they would only take it as a trade in if the screen wasnt broken We took off the protector and the phones scene was unharmed Will always use this product ,negative
I bought this based on the recommendation of the Best Buy associate It seems fine and its worked without any issues My biggest complaint is it seems a little small for the Samsung S7 There is a small gap between the edge of the protective screen and the edge of the phones screen ,positive
the screen protector does not curve at the edges and overhangs The screen protector is brittle and breaks easily at those edges the phone fell on my bed then to the carpet and broke at the edge where it overhangs on the first day dont waste your money on this product find one that curves at the edge ,negative
Ive had good luck with Zagg products in the past this screen protector is no exception I have a problem with the edges of the screen protector cracking this isnt a knock on the product I think the case Im using is causing the problem Otherwise the protector does what its supposed to do ,negative
Dont do what I didRead reviews mainly negative and still purchaseAs stated by others the sides lift causing the glass to separate and chip Took less than a month for this product to become inferior and returned for a full refundI recommend the Lifeproof Fre case for the Samsung Galaxy G7 ,negative
I hate having air bubbles or scratches on my screen protectors and this has solved my problem It is well worth the cost Also the best buy rep put the screen protector on for me so I did not stress too much about dust or air bubbles between the screen and the protector Thank you so much ,negative
I bought this for my new phone Zagg glass works as advertised When I had it on my old phone and the glass cracked I was able to get a new one from Zagg The process was easy and even easier to put it on my phone myself This definitely protects your phone screen and is worth every single dollar ,positive
This screen protector chips way too easily Several days after having it installed on my phone it cracked on the edge without any apparent cause It looks like a small preexisting edge defect allowed the glass to chip next to the power button After several more days a crack formed and grew ,negative
Does not adhere to the curved edges allowing dirt dust and hair to get stuck to the exposed section Zagg calls it full coverage and claims that it is by design But then explained they are currently working on a redesig Not sure how its getting 35 stars over all with all these bad reviews ,negative
good clear protect except does not stick to the edge of the screen creating a halo edge effect this impacts the touch screen sensitivity as you must press harder in that area to make it work Installed at Best Buy who promised to notify me when a fix is available still waiting several months ,positive
I love the products but not this version Day one the glass cracked and webbed Day 3 or the second one and it shattered and webbed Im ocd about protecting my phones and this was with general use and button push home screen area on gs7 Avoid this get the regular plasticoriginal screen protector ,negative
This is 2nd Zagg shield for this phone The 1st one suffered a crack after falling from roof of house onto a rock pile I thought phone would be destroyed but thanks to Zagg and a dollar store case the phone and screen were fine Thanks Zagg ,negative
Disappointed that this screen broke in less than 24 hrs I didnt drop my phone or drop anything on it Just looked over and the screen was cracked Happy that Zagg replaces the screen for free minus shipping and handling but I shouldnt have had to use this free pass so soon or without reason ,negative
We dropped my phone on rocks in Maui taking a selfie and it looked like the screen was shattered but it was only the zagg protector that was shattered and they mailed me a new one for only a few dollars in shipping costs ,positive
To start I will say the screen protector is easy to install but the glass does not completely adhere to the phone leaving an air gap the whole way around the phone allowing dust to easily make its way under the edges For the price of this thing the edges should be flawless ,positive
waited a couple months until zagg fixed their measuring errors for the samsung galaxy s7 screen protector but i think i still bought an old version if they even fixed the error i never attached the screen but holding it to my phone it still looked small and for the price wouldnt risk it ,negative
dont waste your money on this screen saver i purchased new when i bought new phone dropped it one time and shattered along the edge wife bought the same thing and the exact same thing happened with hers we will be going back to the old nonglass style screen saver in the future ,positive
Do not buy this for your phone if you expect it to fit your phone from edge to edge Even though it is for a S7 and not a S7 edge the phones screen is still a little curved and it will not lay flat on the edges of the screen It also will collect lint dirt etc along the edges ,negative
This glass shield for the Samsung S7 has known problems halo around edges does not seal but I decided to get because I figured some protection is better than none I have gotten several replacements from Zagg through their lifetime warranty 599 shipping which theyre good about ,positive
The glass screen does not follow the contour around the edges of the Galaxy S7 The phone has a downward slope and the glass does not bend Hence there is a noticeable edge around the entire edgeI gave it a two because Zagg customer service was great and provided me a non glass replacement ,positive
screen protection is great doesnt seem to scratch 3 stars do to the edges of the protector do not contour to the phone screen After having the phone in my pocket for a few weeks there is a noticeable amount of lint between the screen and the protector at the edges ,positive
I bought this when recommended by the Best Buy guy So far its been good I have dropped my phone a few times with no problems Its only been a month so I am not sure if It will actually prevent my phone from cracking but so ive dropped my phone and neither the shield or the screen have cracked ,negative
This screen protector does not fit all the way to the sides Evidently the s7 is slightly beveled on the edges Im sure the next generation will be better At the time of purchase it was all that was available It does the job but Id like better fit and finish not that Id sacrifice function ,positive
Im super clumsy when it comes to my phone Ive dropped the thing way to many times but this product saves my screen every time Whats even better is that it has a great warranty so when I inevitably crack the screen protector Ill be able to get another Well worth the price ,positive
One of the worst protectors Ive had to replace twice already it cracks on its own I went from having iPhone to galaxy purchase same product before in the past which I had great experience with but on this phone the product isnt durable doesnt last not even a month dont waste your money ,negative
I got this for my wifes phone and it saved her screen when it fell off her lap while she was sitting in the car and it landed screen first on the driveway The screen protector shattered but her phone was completely undamaged I bought this one to replace her first one ,negative
I really like the glass screen I got for my my new Samsung S7 it is very clear no bubbles on the screen I did get one scratch on it already but I am also very hard on my phone and I dropped them a lot so I wouldnt say it was a bad product had I not had one on my screen would have been cracked ,negative
ZAGG Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Bought this item when I bought my phone walked out of best buy and dropped my phone while getting in my truck hit ground and the shield cracked Ill never waist my money again on this ,negative
The edges of the glass do not meet the screen functions just fine but the official stance from zagg as of now is It works as intended if you dont want the halo get a different shield I have seen the press release in store my self This is nonsense ,positive
You definitely need this to protect your screen In less than one month I needed a new protector Fortunately I had this otherwise the screen wouldve been cracked in several places The rep was also helpful in getting this shipped out quickly and the best buy folks put it on the phone ,positive
This protector never adhered properly There was about 18 around the entire screen that just didnt stick Slowly more seems to be peeling up Its also already cracked in 4 places without being dropped or hit Im usually satisfied with Zagg protectors but not this one ,positive
The edges dont stick On the second day it cracked I took it back and they couldnt replace it because I have to go through Zapp and pay for shipping to get a new one its been one month since Ive had it and a have multiple cracks and I have not dropped my phone once Its just super sensitive ,negative
I have had two of these screen protectors in the last 2weeks and my new one was for the Samsung galaxy s7 and it doesnt appear to fit there is a halo around the whole screen Best buy was amazing for fixing the first one hoping the company fixes this in the future ,positive
Although you cant see it you know that it is there and it is protecting your investment your phone Since I put my phone directly in my purse and who knows what is it there I know that there will not be any scratches on the phones glass when I pull it out of my purse I would recommend ,negative
I have to put a screen protector on my phone for my own piece of mind This one however doesnt lay perfectly flat because if the tiny curve to the screen It has been ok but you can see a little outline area around the outside that isnt laying perfectly flat ,positive
This screen protector has protected my screen pretty well I had one on my last phone that kept it protected the whole two years The only complaint I would have is that the screen protector looks scratched or cracked and it almost looks like my phones screen is really cracked but its not ,negative
The Zagg Shield has saved the cell phone several times when it fell great product They also have a great customer svc dept I had a zagg on a previous phone that was about 4 yrs old and it started getting bubbles and dirt under it they replaced it with no issues Very easy process ,negative
My Wife bought one for her iPhone and it fit great so I bought one for my Galaxy S7 it didnt fit well at all The edges wouldnt stay down nothing we did would keep the edges down Waste of money now I have to find one that will actually work on the S7 ,positive
Because of the halo edges that are around the perimeter the screen covers cracks easily I never had this happen before but I have put two new screen protectors on and both have cracked within a day or two Not recommended ,negative
Cracks too easy and my girlfriend dropped her phone and the protector cracked and allowed the screen on phone to get scratched itself I have dropped my phone many times with a different style and it hasnt even tried cracking ,negative
Either BestBuy associates are putting the screen protector on incorrectly or this is simply a bad choice for the Samsung s7 1st time it cracked around the edges on day 3 Ordered a free replacement from Zagg Brought it to Best Buy to put on cracked around the edges again on day 2 ,negative
This cover is to protect your phone screen and it did that but in just a short time not even two weeks noticed a slight nick in it Had one before this for two years and never had one problem with it It was for an Iphone not a Samsung so not sure if that is the difference or what ,negative
Not sure if it protects the screen from impact because I havent dropped it It does seem to be chipped on an edge I noticed a white spot when it was installed at Best Buy now it seems to chip away Lifetime guarantee but zagg wants about 13 of the price I paid for the exchange ,positive
I paid 3999 for this screen protector at the advice of Best Buy staff I did not drop my phone or even bump it but the glass protector is already cracked after just 24 hours I had the cheap plastic one on my other phone and it never had anything go wrong in 2 years DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ,negative
Because the 7 curves a little the glass shield does not sit flush on the edges Within a few days it already cracked My boyfriend got the same one and his lasted about 2 weeks before it cracked Now we have to go thru warranty to get another one Looking for a different protector ,negative
Disappointed in the durability of this screen shield Have only had for a couple of months and shield is already cracked in a couple places Will go with a plastic shield as a replacement when this shield is no longer tolerable Much cheaper alternative with better longterm protection ,positive
This shield is absolutely great It keeps my phone safe from cracks when dropped and the screen is now so crystal clear to view Even my fingerprints dont show on the phone Wish I had gotten one sooner Makes a great Christmas gift for family and friends ,positive
I always prefer the glass for screen protectors but this glass is NOT shaped exactly the same as the phone which leaves a halo on both sides where the screen protector doesnt actually touch the screen I may end up removing the glass and switching to a plastic screen protector ,positive
This brand is always awesome But on this phone The HD glass cover does not work well Since the edges are slightly rounded there is a halo effect when the class is on there meaning the edges around the whole screen protector slightly lift off of the glass ,positive
Love how this feels when swiping and also protecting HOWEVER this will not fully seal around the edges of glass I took it back to Best Buy and asked the Geek Squad and they said it never will Seems that it should seal that last 116 Will find out how much dirt gets around it ,negative
Bought and had best buy install in store While the associate was installing cover he warned me of the cover not fitting properly the screen has a slight curve at the edge while the protector does not Have had for 3 days and have cracks al through out edges do not buy ,negative
this cover allowed for no damage after i dropped my phone on the pavement in 20 degree weather so it did its jobhoweveri find that the touch screen and texting require a lot more pressure than my old plastic screen cover it works but it kind of deadens the touch response ,negative
Ive used invisibleshield on just about every phone Ive had since 2010 This particular one is very difficult to install correctly and the install wipe is terrible Ended up buying the original style invisibleshield which was much easier to install and has served me well so far ,positive
This was highly recommended as THE screen protector to get for my Galaxy S7 and I agree No problems whatsoever using my phone It also gives me peace of mind that it will Crack instead of my screen Was told it has free lifetime replacements If true then well worth the money ,positive
The glass shield gives me an extra sense of protection I have dropped the phone since I purchased it and thankfully it did not chip or break I would like to think the glass shield prevented any damage to the phone I hope not to drop it again to prove my theory wrong Smile ,negative
I had the gadget geeks at best buy put this screen on for me Im not sure if I got a defective one from the beginning but it brokecracked within the first few days and I had not dropped it or anything I went back in to best buy and they did refund my money for the purchase ,positive
The protector applied easily without air bubbles The problem I have with the Galaxy S7 is near the screen edges it has a slight curve which doesnt allow the protector to adhere right up to its edges Time will tell if this will present to be an issue ,negative
Husband eyes are sensitive to light so he wears polarized sunglasses which this glass shield leaves lines throughout the screen but if you hold it sideways its fine We will have to return this due to this reason other wise it might work for others without these type of glasses ,positive
DO NOT BUY I only purchase Zagg Glass for my phones This product is poorly designed for the S7 The edges of the Glass do not seal The S7 has a slight contour that does not allow the Glass to seal properly Very disappointed with Zagg ,negative
This is the best screen protector Ive ever owned Its a little on the pricey side but protector doesnt diminish the phones resolution quality and protects your screen from impacts Ive dropped my phone several times on the face No cracks on the protector or scratches ,negative
I didnt know or wad told when i bought this product that the edges do not seal properly due to a curve on the phones screen When the tech put it on my phone he broke one Within two weeks of the second one it also got a chip in it The glass screen for my s5 never broke once ,negative
Best protector out there May be a little more money then others but well worth the If you register screen and something happens to it they will send you a new one Great product for 5 different phones for me personally ,positive
At first use the screen protector is made of good material and went on smoothly At first I thought I got the wrong one but once I talked to a clerk found out that they are not made of the curve of the screen on the edges So just a tad of material sticks out beyond the screen ,positive
Great screen protector It is durable very transparent You cant even tell it is there yet you are getting the protection from costly screen damage repair It does not interfere with the touch screen use I recommend this for protection peace of mind ,positive
very good shield bought two of these when getting my phones my son tried to adjust his glass screen protector and ended up breaking the screen protector we contacted the company and within a week we had a new screen protector with no hassles from the company Im impressed with them ,negative
Protects cell phone screen just as described I dropped my phone hit pavement protective shield cracked hairline crack removed it from phone my phone screen was intact Sent it back to manufacturer and they sent me back a replacement shield honoring their lifetime warranty ,negative
Ive gone through two of these It doesnt adhere to the edges of the screen so it cracks and you cant use the edges of the touch screen like the period button on the keyboard So now Im out the purchase price as well as the 599 for warranty replacement shipping Terrible product ,positive
The sales guy at best buy said that the way this is made that the edges arent down This seemed odd and this week I found out that it is odd The glass screen chipped There is a lifetime warranty but you have to pay for shipping I hope the one I receive sits better on the screen ,negative
The only thing that makes this screen protector any better than the cheaper ones is that you can get a replacement if you register it for the lifetime warranty Other than that go with the cheaper one It protected my screen but its already cracked in less than 2 months ,positive
I have a Galaxy S7 and the edges are showing shadows I talk to Best Buy about it and they said there is a specific protector for the Galaxy S7 but they do not carry it Talked to Zagg and they said there is not a specific protector for the S7 and that this was a known issue ,negative
These screen savers have saved my cell phone many times from having to replace the screen every time I drop it Instead just replace the screen saver the glass screen underneath is in perfect shape It is the first accessory I buy when getting a new phone ,positive
My wife was changing phone cases and dropped her phone With this on her phone she has a crack from the dropping I doesnt work and I had to have mine replaced What a run around Two trips to the store had to contact vendor pay for shipping for replacement ,negative
The protection factor is great on this thing the attractiveness isnt Upon applying it to my phone then putting on the case parts of it bubbled up and makes the appearance less attractive Its not the worst thing in the world but I wasnt thrilled about this small dilemma ,positive
Bought my first Invisibleshield Glass Screen protector So far I love the glass shield because unlike the plastic screen protectors that you can scratch and gouge the plastic on the screen protectorI have had it on my phone for a month and no indication of gouging ,negative
I think with technology advancing the way it is the term Cell Phone needs to be further extended to include all the features of these handheld giantsPerhaps a name the widget campaign to rename the device to all persons to all persons who own one may promote a true identity ,negative
For the Samsung S7 this brand of screen protectors are horrible All of them come up around the edges due to the phone having a very slight curvature Its just a waste of money Ive found better screen protectors by other brands that are the same price and dont come up ,negative
Bought this it torecracked the first day I got it I should have taken it back immediately but I went through the guarantee process which cost another 6 for shipping Have now read other reviews warning this cover doesnt fit well and I can confirm the same Dont bother ,negative
It protects my screen well enough but it doesnt cover the sides as well as I thought it would since the s7 is slightly curved No real problems installing it and fits well minus the problem I mentioned before ,positive
This screen protector was easy to apply but it did not fit very well It never sealed very good around the edges of the screen I will probably try another brand when this one starts to come loose as it certainly looks like that will happen in the very near future ,positive
I had bought this noticed product before and it started to crack on the side thought it was the glass of the phone but it was the shield Better the shield than the phone so I bought an other on and installed it within minutes Works and looks great ,negative
New S7 Protector started to deteriorate within days of putting it on I went back to BB and was told they had numerous complaints Apparently the phone is curved in such a way that it rejects the protector I was told Zagg would be coming out with a protector compatible with the S7 ,negative
The concept is a good idea however it chipped and cracked the first day just being in my pocket with my keys and some change To replace I have to deal directly with Zagg and then take it to Best Buy for installation Both are fully covered but a real pain to make work ,negative
The product works as advertised I have not broken a screen since I started using these 3 or 4 phones ago I now upgrade my phone because I want to instead of having too because of a broken screen ,negative
I gave the screen protector 4 stars because it chips kind of easy when the phone is dropped Unfortunately I have dropped it a couple of times but it did help protect the screen which is the purpose I still like the product and will buy it again when I upgrade later on ,positive
I have the same screen for my phone and it has been great for two years So when my husband needed a new screen protector I felt this would be best Unfortunately it has already broken If they stand by their lifetime guarantee then my rating will go up to a 5 ,positive
Great InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Protects my Samsung Galaxy S7 device with this InvisibleShield glass screen cover Featuring fortified tempered glass construction this cover defends against scratches to extend your screen ’ s life ,negative
Simple item and doesnt its job so cant complain much strangely it seems to gap in clean line on both sides as if for the edge instead of the regular s7 Now due to that gap its cracked along an edge but its still working so functionality matters most ,negative
This did not fit to the edge of my s7 it had a halo around all the edges I could not get used to the look Very disappointed Do not buy Zagg is working on making a glass screen protector for this phone you can ask Zagg to email you when one is available I suggest waiting ,negative
This was so slick The salesperson put on in store Immediately adheres to screen and is clear without bubbles My husband got one for his too His cracked on the side within days not sure what happened there but received a replacement free of charge We both have been pleased ,positive
I have always liked my Zagg protectors on other phones but due to the slight curve on the S7 this protector wouldnt adhere to the edges and left an easy gap to peal off Returned very easily to Best Buy No complaints with the service just a poorly designed product ,negative
I love that the screen protector looks and feels like the plain screen of the phone but the edges of this protector did not glue tight to the screen and made my new phone look used and beat up Ended up removing and buying a better brand online ,positive
I told the salesman I wanted one of those screen savers for my phone and he pick this one out and was good enough to install it on my phone for me He did a good job and I dont even notice that it is even on it It is clear and will help save my screen from getting mark up ,positive
My screen looks cracked Hopefully it is the Zagg glass screen I will find out when I bring it in to Best Buy to check out The glass screen makes a great display It is clear and smudgeless Zagg always stands behind their products so I am hopeful to have it replaced ,positive
I bought one of these after I broke the glass on my Galaxy S7 about 2 weeks later the phone slipped from my hands and landed dead on it face on jagged rocks and the screen protector cracked but my phone was fine 35 bucks is much better than 200 to replace the screen ,negative
This was recommended by Best Buy personnel DO NOT GET IT It will leave the edges unsealed I spoke with ZAGG about this and they have another product for the nonEDGE S7 that they sell that Best Buy does NOT sell get it from them ,positive
I will say that this item does what it is supposed to do I dropped my phone and it shattered the screen protector My phone screen however was completely intact Definitely worth the I paid for it I use this with the otter box defender case ,positive
doesnt fit phone properly thus cracking at the edges Its a poor design I wouldnt recommend this product if you want to keep you phone looking nice It is under warranty but I dont want to have to go back in every couple of weeks and replace my screen protector ,positive
This screen protector was recommended by the Samsung rep as well as the Best Buy employee and Im not happy that they did not know it would not fit the phone correctly Lots of dirty gets stuck under the edge because it does not fit the screen correctly Otherwise it is fine ,positive
Phones these days are basically just mini computers with price tags to match I wouldnt let my investment go unprotected These work exceptionally well and they are guaranteed a free replacement if they crack as long as you register your purchase ,positive
Overall I like this screen protector It went on relatively easily without too many bubbles However I am concerned that the area along both the left and right edges of the screen protector dont appear to be completely adhering to the phones screen ,positive
This is not the best protector for your phone but it does cover you screen and protect it You will notice on the side of the protector that it doesnt completely stick to your phone I have dust collecting on the sides But it is doing exactly as advertised ,positive
Within a couple days after the screen protector was applied to my phone by a Best Buy sales associate it had already started to chip and actually cut my finger when I was reaching in my purse to get the phone It also has a huge bubble on the top left side ,positive
This is not a good screen cover and I would not recommend it Within a few days of install by the Best Buy Geek squad it started peeling back and coming off I was given a replacement and it did the same thing For the cost you would think it would stay on for a while ,positive
My Galaxy s7 has the curved screen edges This shield appeared to not cover the screen enough and would cause a problem with the edges lifting up from use I found a case that included a screen protector and meets my high standard of protecting a very expensive phone ,negative
I purchased 2 new phones and wanted a reliable screen protector The sales associate recommended this product 2 weeks later one of the screen protectors is cracked on the side which could easily cut fingers I am giving this a 2 star rating because of this ,positive
The edges of the S7 screen are apparently slightly curved However this screen protector apparently is not The edges of the protector never adhered to the screen edges As a result several cracks developed in the edges of the screen protector ,negative
I have dropped my phone a couple of times while trying to juggle too many items and the only damage I have is to the corner of my shield glass No damage to the actual phone glass I have been using these shields for the past 4 years and love them ,negative
Great screen protector Honestly my favorite thing about it is not having to clean the screen simply wipe it with a clean cloth Only reason for 4 stars is even the standard S7 has a slight curve on the edges of the screen so interacting with the edges can be difficult ,positive
The protector is good until it broke very easily while my charger hit the top Its not very good protection but when its brand new it feels so smooth The guy who put it on did a good job but these bubble marks were around the sides ,positive
I do not recommend this tempered glass screen for the Galaxy S7 Because the S7 has a slight curve on the side it leaves giant space between the screen of my phone and the tempered glass allowing dust and other funny stuff to get inside I suggest the HDX instead ,negative
Goddmaybe even very good It does have a small chip now It doesnt bother me My granddaughter dropped my phone on concrete It bounced but didnt break Without the shield Im sure there would have been major damage ,negative
Ive used other brands of screan protectors before Zagg has always been the best NOT in this case The halo allows for the screan protector alows ot to lift up and if you have a case on the phone its even worse It pushes on it too Very disappointed ,negative
It was difficult to install and if you mess up the installation the product is ruined Once it is installed it easily scratches on the surface While not on your screen it becomes difficult to see when they build up over time ,negative
Easy to install Does what it says and has prevented scratches and breaks TO MY SCREEN But simply dropping it in my pocket with other items will cause it to be scratched and busted causing the purchase of another one Drop the price ,negative
I tried cheaper brand screen protectors The protector itself cracked up so couldnt view phone screen Zagg worth the money Performs as stated though did not last a full year Perhaps warranty would cover it My first Zagg lasted 6 months ,positive
I really bought it for my Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge phone because this is what popped up there when I typed in the search bar online for the screen protector for it Its an okay one for the Samsung Galaxy s7 phone If I had to go with a different one I would ,negative
Glass is simple to install and has a lifetime guarantee I had one break on a previous phone and getting a replacement was simple Only issue I have with this one is that it is difficult to get the glass on with 0 air trapped but its a minor thing ,negative
Bought the glass screen cover after best buy employee recommendation It cracked and started peeling in the front by camera lense within 3 weeks Didnt drop phone or anything else to cause it on my end Took it back and got it replaced So far so good with this one ,positive
I love Zagg but this protector isnt a good match for the S7 The S7 has a slightly curved screen unlike the S7 Edge which has a fully curved screen and the protector is about 18116 short of sticking to the full screen I expect better from Zagg ,positive
The product halos which means it doesnt form fit and all around the shield it pops up a little It keeps popping off And it is super irritating And it doesnt span across the entire screen This sucks I wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE ,negative
I purchased this product for my previous phone and after dropping my phone 1000 times or so I finally cracked my screen protector Zagg replaced it quickly and easily no problem Its an excellent product saves me from my clumsiness and I am a fan for life ,negative
The protector is very nice in the middle but it doesnt curve for the edge of the screen There is a halo all the way around that doesnt touch Being inside my pocket it gets little pieces of things underneath it ,positive
I have dropped my phone way too much The Zagg glass protector has just a tiny crack along the edge I know it has been protecting my phone so that glass on the phone itself hasnt cracked Phew ,negative
The screen protector is okay when using your phone but when the phone is off you can see an edge all the way around the phone as if the screen protector isnt sticking correctly ,positive
This product is good to protect scratches but I dont think it is worth the retail price they are charging for it When talking to a Best Buy associate they informed me BB would price match Amazon which saved me a about 40 For that price I think it is a good deal ,positive
The S7 provides me with a much clearer and brighter screen It is much easier to delete calls and EMails as a group I read facebook a lot and the quality of pictures etc Is great I am thoroughly enjoying my n ew S7 phone ,positive
The Zagg invisible glass shield is protective for the screen of my Samsung S7 That should be expected The fit to the screen is not very good The shield lifts at the edges and in one corner of the screen the shield has cracked because of this problem ,negative
Crystal clear protection for your phones screen It has a nice natural feel to the touch screen when applied The only down side is that it does crack more easily than other screen protectors Better for the protector to crack than the screen itself however ,positive
Seemed very nice at the beginning My toddler got ahold of my phone and dropped it The screen protector is cracked Although I am happy nothing happened to the phone It was less than a foot drop for the protector to break I will be calling for a replacement ,negative
I am not thrilled with it but it is ok enough that I will live with it The problem is the the S7 has a slight bevel to the glass so this overlay does not seal tight on the edges As a result it collects little dust crumbs that make me crazy Bleh ,negative
Had one on my last phone and it lasted two and a half years before I replaced my phone It had only a couple of small cracks from dropping the phone but better Zagg protection then cracking my phone screen I will keep buying ZAGG screen protectors ,positive
Dont know what happened Have never dropped the phone but this has cracked on one phone after two months I am using it with a Samsung flip cover so that front of the phone and so this screen protector is always covered when the phone is not actually in use ,negative
These glass screen protectors work great and have saved my sons screen from cracking on his Samsung phone The screen protector cracked but not the actual screen Zagg does charge a 599 shipping and handling fee but replaces the protector at no cost ,positive
Very easy to install very clear like the glass It broke in the first week Best Buy exchanged but I hope I dont have to do that every week If you use outside or in a car it is impossible to read if you have polarized lens Must be the anti glare they put on it ,negative
I installed the Zagg myself which is not my strong suit I have to admit its easy to do but you only have one shot at getting it right If money is not an option it is far easier to pay Best Buy to install the shield but this one is easy enough to do by yourself ,positive
Have used zagg products on my last few phones They work well and do their job They do Crack after a decent fall since they are glass but the warranty makes up for a replacement just paying for shipping Which is minimal cost compared to replacing a phone screen ,positive
The glass is clear and allows a easy view of all icons Application was a little trickey since its a 1 shot deal I could not get all the air bubbles and while trying to reajust the scene it cracked ,positive
the glass dont curve with the phone the edge did not stick return it the first time cause thought it was a defect from me putting it so pay them to put on and said the glass will curved after couple days but never did and started to crack around the edge ,negative
Recently the screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S7 shattered I went to Best Buy where a courteous and knowledgeable Best Buy employee expertly and quickly replaced the screen protector My phone looks as it did when I purchased it Thanks Best Buy ,positive
This product does not fit the S7 phone Mine cracked during the install so I returned it to the local retailer The phone has a slight curve on the edge and the screen protector is completely flat leaving a slight gap on the sides Horrible product ,negative
This screen protector will probably work fine however per the store clerk for some reason the edge all the way around has a slight lip due to the S7 screen being slightly beveled I think its still the best choice for the phone ,positive
Screen protector works well but it doesnt fit the screen of the phone correctly The edge of the phone is slightly curved and the glass cover doesnt bend You end up with a halo around the edge of the phone and dust can gather underneath that edge ,positive
Best screen protector but the glass screen protector for galaxy 7 does not seal around the edge of the screen The screen slightly curves and the glass protector doesnt adhere to it Great product with a slight problem Hopefully Zagg will come up with a solution ,negative
This is my second screen saver for this phone The first one did its job and protected my phone when if fell out of my pocket Im sure this one will do the same It also has a lifetime warranty if you register it I didnt do this on the first one ,negative
Ive bought Zagg products in the past and I bought this based on my experience with them The protector is great Very clear It does not go to the edges of the phone and mine is lifting up a little bit because of this But overall great product ,positive
I found this product to be everything it said it would be It is in my purse and has not suffered scratches from keys pens etc My only complaint is that it could be a tad bigger It doesnt comepletely cover my screen But I would definitely recommend it ,negative
I bought this took it back I got told I only had 15 days of purchase 53 for this screen protector and 8 to put it on NEVER AGAIN I am going to cancel my membership No way am I going to spend money there again ,negative
Ive bought a few Zagg shields in the past for other phones always great easily applied to phone never crack or anything This one did not go on my new phone as smoothly Galaxy 7 AND the shield actually brokeshattered at one of the edges no idea how ,positive
I was hesitant about using the glass protector as opposed to the screen protector that came with my OtterBox I went ahead and applied it which was very easy it covers the screen nicely and does not inhibit the touchpad screen ,negative
I purchased this item bc i had something similar on my last phone The shield was super simple to put on and it hasnt moved since It keeps my phone protected and it hasnt shown signs of peeling or anything like that Will recommend product and brand ,positive
The screen protector doesnt quite fit right The edges of the s7 screen are slightly curved and the protector is totally flat I got it only a few weeks ago and its already cracked Waiting for the proper fitting screen protector to come out before I replace it ,positive
The best part of this product was the small additional fee I paid to have it installed The Best Buy sales person puts them on all the time and she installed mine in record time with no bubbles alignment errors or other common problems ,negative
Annoying prism effect on edges Item cracked after less than 3 weeks and I did not drop the phone A warranty replacement will cost 5 for shipping and I dont want another glass one so have ordered a set of plastic ones ,negative
Zagg is my go to screen protector for all of the phones Ive had and its the one I recommend to family and friends With free lifetime replacement for as long as you have the device its a great deal so just spend the extra money on it in the beginning ,positive
Previous Zagg glass were awesome This one didnt fit the slight radius leftright edges on the S7 Left an annoying 116 strip not adhered took less than a week to get caught and I removed it The S7 is durable with out it ,positive
I like the overall protection and warranty but really wish Zagg could figure out how to get the protector to cover ALL of the screen including the curved edges I already have a small crack on the edge of my screen at the edge of the ZAGG shield ,positive
Have used Zagg protectors before Great product Perfectly clear and easy to apply Purchased online late one evening and picked it up at a local Best Buy the next day after work It was on sale that week so that was an extra bonus ,positive
This is designed to prevent glass scratches or breakage saving you hundreds of dollars in repairs or replacement Best part is if you damage it LIFE TIME WARRANTY just register it on line That in itself will save you money in the future ,negative
Best screen protection you can buy My only negative comment is the halo around the edge of the phone It doesnt really stand out or anything but it does appear to ever so slightly degrade the touch sensitivity around the left and right edges but its not bad ,negative
I always get a screen protector for my phones and so far Im vey happy with the quality of protection this screen protector has given me Its hardly noticeable made of quality material adheres well and smudges wipe clean easily with a soft cloth ,positive
Wonderful little item that not only would I recommend but suggest that you pay the Geek Squad to put it on 800 The first one they did had some air bubbles so they broke open a new box and did it again Not an option when you try it yourself ,negative
we just recently got our phones put the Zagg shield on it and my husbands already broke i understand we can send it back and get a new one FREE but its a hassle to have to do that already and then to put it on again so far mine is ok ,negative
The process of putting this on was actually pretty easy Ive used other brands that would be off or short and wouldnt cover the whole screen Ive been using these for a while and it really does help the protection of the screen ,positive
Very disappointed with this product edges of glass do not lay flat on screen Was told this at store once it was put on all Zagg S7 shields fit like that Returned it immediately Have always purchased Zagg shields and first issue with the product ,negative
Always trust Zagg products protection you can trust I have purchased other brands in the past but have come to the conclusion on investing in buying Zagg products first I no longer buy other brands of any type of screen protection its a waste of money ,positive
Love the glass protector Although I did have to have the first one replaced as it wasnt properly adhered to the phone and it cracked Best Buy replaced it as it was only a day old New one adhered properly has has kept my phone screen in good shape ,positive
I dropped my phone down a flight of wood stairs It bounced three times The screen protector cracked in 3 places but the screen underneath was left completely unscathed Excellent product I replaced with the same product because it worked so well ,positive
I recently purchase a Samsung Galaxy S7 I bought the screen protector with it because the Best Buy associate suggested it she also installed it for me and told me about the lifetime warranty it was a great purchase and I definitely recommend it ,positive
Helps protect your screen very well Dropped my cellphone several times and protected it better than my expectations It eventually cracked but helped out a lot Still using it need to use the warranty to get another one Very satisfied with the product ,positive
I got this screen protector from Best Buy about a month ago and I am really please with it It is invisible on the phone and it has made my phone look like a new phone I have dropped is a couple times and no hint of any damage ,negative
First one I got for a Galaxy S7 not an Edge did not stick down at edges Could not return to Best Buy and after two tries talking with Zagg they admitted that it was a design flaw and sent a new one at no charge Seems to be OK now ,negative
Have always been impressed with Zagg but not this time Appears they rushed a product to market Halo effect with the flat protector is an visual issue along with a great dustcrud gatherer Your pockets will stay clean because this thing collects all of it ,positive
This was my third purchase for this phone Not happy with quality of product or difficulty of getting replacement Salesperson says at least screen didnt crack ,negative
Does not fit the phone Samsung S7 Edges does not adhere to the sides of the phone causing dust and debris to get stuck Best Buy associate that installed it said that the first ones that come out are not made to size Need to return and get one that fits ,negative
The Zagg Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector is easy to apply unlike the old Zagg protectors where one had to spray the phone or tablet first It does not seem to interfere with touch response and is a quality product I do not regret purchasing this ,negative
This screen protectors fit and finish if very poor it does not fit tight to the screen leaving an air gap around the border which not only looks like bad but allows dust to make its way under the screen protector and the phone ,negative

The edge of the S7 is slightly curved the Zagg is flat I have already cracked 2 in less than a month until they get it to fit properly on the screen I would not buy I do have the lifetime but cmon I dont want to replace it every couple of weeks ,negative
It works good but the outer edge of the shield doesnt stick so it looks like a frame when the phone is not on When the phone is on you dont notice the edges I asked the samsung rep and he said it was a known issue by samsung but they all do this ,positive
These glass screen protectors are nice They are pretty fragile though I have already replaced it once after a week Replacements are free as long as you register your screen protector with the company on their website The clarity of them are good ,positive
I dropped my phone it appeared my phone cracked in the corner top as well as bottom 3 cracks in all I was freaking out and then I peeled the screen saver off and my phone is perfect Love it ,negative
This is actually a replacement after my last protector broke but lets just say that it totally saved my phone Its way better to replace this cracked screen protector rather than replacing a 700 phone Money well spent ,negative
Perfect fit and full coverage of the screen but a little difficult to apply I had the store clear install it because theyve done hundreds It would not be easy for a first time install Easy to wipe clean and has not scratched at all ,positive
This screen protector installed extremely easy but because of the beveled edges of the screen it wont lay flat I called the company and they are aware of the issue and are working on a fix They will send a new one when they are ready for free ,positive
Ive always protected my phone with these screen protectors This time on our new S7s they dont fit rightthey are lifted from edges when I took back to store all they suggested was to exchange with the darker so it couldnt be seen Not cool ,negative
Two thick lines remain on both sides of the phone they do not interfere when the screen is brilliant however they are very noticeable when the screen is off or with low bright It seems to do its function well ,positive
I always have the Zagg protective shield installed on my phone to keep the original glass screen pristine It doesnt interfere with your touch screen sensitivity This is the best company of all the companies that make protective shields ,positive
It does the job The fit isnt great but I guess that is to be expected when you get the phone before it is released to the public At some point I will send it back for a better fit but as always it does a great job protecting an expensive investment ,positive
Ive had 2 of these protectors in less than a year 2nd was purchased few weeks agoalready cracked Also there is some weird halo effect going on around the sides of the screen Im super easy on phones so this product just sucks ,negative
I read all the reviews and this seemed like the best screen protector even though it was the most expensive It was a little tricky to put on but I finally got it done It doesnt show fingerprints and doesnt add a lot of weight to my phone ,negative

Ive now returned 3 Zagg glass covers for my S7 and the protectors do not fit wellDo not buy this product it was not designed nor engineered well and is not worth itZagg did not account for the slight curvature of the screen on the S7 ,positive
I prefer the Invisible HD Screen protector I am accustomed to and returned this glass I found that it tended to pop upbubble at the edges It seems to have trouble staying secured because of its rigidity unlike the flexible Invisible HD shield ,negative
This is a nice screen protector its very clear and cleans nicely My only complaint is that Ive found that it takes a little more pressure when typing since this screen protector is a little thicker its just a slight relearning process ,positive
I have had these screen protectors on several phones All have cracked or broken within two weeks of application But the phone glass is not broken which is why I have the protector on So its doing its job and Zagg has a lifetime replacement policy ,negative
I would not recommend putting this on yourself Maybe with practice these are easy to put on but I would definitely pay someone to do it for you Other than that the functionality of it and quality is great ,positive
Ive tried a lot of different screen protector products but Zagg tempered glass protectors are the only ones that have never failed me Im hard on phones this product with its lifetime warranty is the best accessory that you can buy for your phone ,negative

I purchased this on my daughters recommendations to go with her new phone I was a little skeptical at first because of it being glass but once it was installed I was so happy I did get it Its a great feature to add to her phone ,positive
Zagg needs to redesign this screen protector to curve with the glass of the Galaxy7 Current model leaves edges exposed allowing for dust particles to get under The part of the screen covered is great allowing for lifetime warranty is fantastic ,positive
About an 18 to 14 of the protector along the entire left and right side of protector does not fully adhere to the screen The protector does not appear to match contourprofile of the standard S7 phone screen ,positive
The protector has worked well so far but the rounded edges of the screen have made it difficult Even with the phone case the protector chipped the first time I dropped it Still keeps my phone safe though And I love the lifetime warranty ,positive
Not sure why this cracked I went back with my receipt to exchange and was very disappointed in the service received Apparently this is warrantied but I have to pay shipping for it That will add up especially since this cracked after 3 weeks ,negative
This is a great product in that it covers the entire screen and is glass 9H However the adhesive is only around the edges and does not adhere to the entire screen This can interfere with some of the touch sensitivity ,negative

I believe in screen savers as I plan to keep this expensive new phone for a long time The edge is barely noticeable I notice no difference in phone usability I am pleased with everything except the very high cost of this screen saver ,positive
It doesnt fit completely over the phone making textinginputting full of errors I was told the halo would improve but it hasnt Would like to know if I can get my money back Not worth the cost but definitely not worth the aggravation ,positive
I Love Zagg shields I dont buy any devices without buying a Zagg shield They protect the screen from getting damaged and their replacement warranty is worth the purchase I have had to replace a few screen protectors and its an easy process ,positive
All of the reviews are correct The glass does not fit the slight curve of the screen leaving the sides unattached A simple catch on anything in my wifes purse will rip the glass off Horrible design ,negative
This is the second time I have purchased this for a phone They are great Still touch sensitive but protect the screen from shattering Have otterbox but dropped phone on pointed object The glass shield cracked but no injury to phone ,negative
I love these screen protectors Mines coming off a bit already Im not sure if its from being put on wrong or not but other than that these are great to have Saves me so many times when dropping my phone on concrete floors at work ,positive
Zagg has been a great product for my family in the past The edges of the screen protector chip away easily I guess it is better the protector than my phone screen The protector is easy to install and i have a clear view of my screen ,positive
I bought this for my last phone Galaxy Note 5 and it saved me from having to replace the screen Old phone took quite a beating from 3 young boys but I peeled off the screen protector the screen looked brand new ,negative
Zagg should not have come out with this project It did not fit and left a horrible fog around the edge I love Zagg Products but this one came to the market too fast Get the new updated curved glass It fits perfect and does not break as easy ,positive
Im not to happy with this product The whole screen saver cracked in half after 3 months Im very careful with my phone This shield comes with a lifetime warranty which is great because Ill be calling for my 3rd screen within a year ,positive
Easy application My 7 year old even commented on how smooth it feels on the screen Prevents scratches well I have dropped my phone a few times and this prevented any damage that could have occurred ,negative
It is a quality product but I am having some problems with the touch recognition on the outside edge because the Samsung Galaxy S7 screen wraps is beveled The screen protector does not sit flush on the phone around the outside edge ,negative
I always buy a screen protect with the purchase of a new phone Zagg has always been my first choice when it comes to screen protectors This protector is ok but it doesnt fit securely on the sides of the screen Thats my only grip ,positive
Having a glass shield on my cell phone is a must I have used this product on all of my cell phones and it definitely is worth the cost It not only is added protection but it is easy to clean the many fingerprints it gets on a daily basis ,positive
Broke after first day I payed 40 for it at 8pm the next morning I wake up and it was all ready cracked It nice if u can keep it that way Every one I know that has one theres I broken as well It nice my screen is buffered but it seems cheap ,positive
Didnt even drop it i layed on it in hoodie pouch edge chipped Took it to customer service to return and it broke in half when i removed it Then Best Buy refused to refund threw 40 bucks in the garbage DO NOT BUY ,negative
The middle of the glass screen looks great just like every other glass screen made by zagg Unfortunately the edge is awful as it is curved and the glass doesnt adhere Will be returning as the fit is bad ,negative
I just brought this product 2 months ago and its already damaged It has a few small cracks on the edge of both sides which eventually caused a crack line across the screen protector It suppose to be a strong product but its not ,negative
I always opt for a quality screen protector and a cheap fun case ZAGG didnt fail me on a Galaxy 5 for 2 years and so far this one is holding up as well Only complaint the edges are peeling up a bit on the sides ,negative
This is also very good protection for your cell The only negative I have is that I sometimes have to poke my finger on the screen pretty hard for it to be sensed by my touch screen Other than that it is a good protector ,positive
I purchased this guard for my new phone Nice and crystal clear while offering maximum protection to the glass front of my phone Came with a lifetime guarantee from the manufacturer I had the Best Buy employee attach it for me Great job ,positive
Ive had two of these now each one chipping on alternate sides within a day or two of applying My wife has the same phone and same screen protector with no issues Zagg does offer replacement but it shouldnt chip within a day ,negative
This screen protector is designed to go on a flat screen and does not work on the S7 It sticks up around the edges and cracks constantly Im on my second one in a little over a month and it already has a chip in the corner ,negative
I didnt like this one because it broke after 2 weeks and 1 little drop I had a protective case too But zagg replaced with better one So i liked that I would recommend the brand but not that certain screen ,positive
The screen protector is easy to keep clean and it does keep my phone screen from getting scratched It was a little challenging to put on wo air bubbles appearing on the screen ,negative
I have a work phone that is touch screen BlackBerry and my experience with that is to say eh But my Galaxy 7 Edge is quite easy to use I like the fact you can set your favorites such as contacts or apps on the edge which makes quick use ,positive
The screen protector doesnt fit the screen as it should i was in contact with Zagg and it is a known problem Zagg themselves has pulled the product from their site for sale until it is fixed I wonder why Best Buy continues to sale it ,negative
Im still up in the air with this screen protector Ive had zagg products in the past but this particular protector already cracked the first week I got my phone I just got the replacement so Ill cross my fingers in hopes this one will work ,negative
This has held up well in the past month it is a must have for the line of work I do on locomotives but so far it has withstood many things I messed up putting it on so there is one little bubble but other than that has been working great ,positive
I always get Zagg screen protectors They do a fantastic job of protecting However there seems to be a region that doesnt adhere to the screen along the edge Its about 116 wide Not distracting though ,negative
Because of the natural curve on the edges of my Galaxy S7 this screen protector kept cracking and breaking while in my pocket due to no support on the edges I went through 6 these in one month not a good buy for this device ,positive
My only issue and its certainly not this glass cover for my phone but the darn things get so messy with fingerprints Seems I am constantly wiping it clean But thats all glass protectors so Im really not complaining ,negative
Best buy had wrong price registerThey correctedProduct is great Great warrantyFit the screen well Easy to install Best buy wanted a lot to install Do it yourself ,positive
Within a month the screen saver was starting to come off My husband had his replaced already My last screen saver lasted a year before showing sign of wear and tear For 40 Im not thrilled but I know the alternative is worse ,positive
Ive always believed in the ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector It it definitely made for the intent of protection of the phone Ive dropped my phone several times and the Invisible Shield does its job ,positive
Does the packaging say invisible I think it does Thats because it is invisible The perfect addition to my phone No issues with it at all Cant tell you how many times this has saved my screen A great product ,negative
I wanted something that I could easily position without air bubbles and easily remove when needed This one has all those features and a free warranty ,positive
The product scratches very easily Within 2 week and just leaving the glass on my dresser it obtain marks within the glass The glass is still intact and overall protects the phone but the screen is not as good as quality for the price paid ,negative
Bought this for my new Galaxy s7 After purchasing it and having Best Buy install it it would not lay down on the edges because the s7 screen curves down slightly on the edges Took it back however and they refunded it no questions asked ,positive
I absolutely love this screen protector It glides real smooth when swiping it cleans up super easy it provides no glare or reflection and it hasnt broken yet even though I drop my phone every once in a while ,positive
This is a great product The sales rep put it on the phone for me Unfortunately they charge a fee to do this but she did a great job making sure there were no air bubbles ,positive
Glass cover cracked within first few months of use A fantastic plus is that the product holds true to its warranty I registered the product and ZAGG sent me a brand new one in the mail All I had to do was mail back the cracked one ,negative
2 other Samsung owners recommended this product to me now I will join to recommend to others A lifetime warranty will make sure your screen remains intact Worth the extra fee to have Best Buy do the install ,positive
It does the job of protecting my screen glass very well No problems or complaints Also it seems easier to clean fingerprints and smudges than the original glass that came on the Samsung Galaxy S7 ,negative
But if a halo doesnt bother you then i would recommend this I hated the rubber one I had on my old phone This HD glass protector has great picture and actually feels like you are using the screen on your phone ,positive
The overall shape of the glass is correct however the edge of the phone tapers off The Zagg glass is prone to crack around the edges this is now my 2nd Zagg screen for the S7 and it is already crackingZagg has been informed ,negative
Only complaint is that the shield does not rest completely on the edge to the phone There is a seal for the shield but about 14 in on the left and right sides and 18 in on the top and bottom that it doesnt adhere to the phone ,positive
The screen protector is a little thicker than other ones I have had in the past but seems to work just fine It probably offers more protection than some of the thinner ones out there ,positive
I wasnt sure about buying this when my salesman showed it to me but Im glad I did Adds to the water resistency of the phone and it was inexpensive Request price match for a lower price ,positive
Should have gotten this from the start Phone cracked with another screen protector but this one does a good job and comes with lifetime warranty ,negative
I have one from a previous phone purchase Good product My problem is that Best buy suggested this for a new phone purchase It does NOT fit a galaxy J7 It was suggested to buy at check out so we did and we had to return it ,negative
After replacing my s7 I searched for a screen protector and decided on this one Within 4 hours the screen was cracked I does not fit fully on the screen I think that is why it cracked to easily ,negative
Could barely see my screen in the sun with this was like a hazy residue underneath Then a few days later the shield just uplifted peeled off and cracked in multiple areas during that process Dont waste your money on this product ,negative
I have used many Zagg products and this one is no different than the rest Its always well worth the purchase especially considering that the warranty is for life I would highly recommend the product for all your electronic products ,positive
Product is greatcomes with a warranty Only problem is that mine has little cracks along the side because it doesnt contour exactly to the phone This is ultimately not a big deal and is still worth the ,negative
Zagg quality has gone down since last time I bought This does not fitcover the screen good It got scratches on it right away just by typing on the phone i have no nails never in pocket or purse ,positive
Its just ok I had it put on at the store It doesnt sit right on the s7 and has air pockets on each side It also got a small Crack the first dayI didnt drop it or anything I guess at least my phone screen isnt cracked ,negative
The rubbery protection started developing bubbles and didnt look good This looks like a seamless glass cover Hopefully will stand the test with a teenager ,positive
I will never use a plastic screen protector again On a clean screen it was super easy to apply Because its glass its really easy to get air bubbles out as it doesnt flex Plus it feels the same as the screen ,positive
I highly recommend staying away from this product Does not adhere to outer edges of screen halo effect and Best Buy slash Geek Squad charges 8 to put it on when its 39 to begin with ,positive
I had it installed at the store it has this weird halo effect on the outer edges The lady who installed it said thats how its supposed to look but its gotten worse in a week IDK may try something else next time ,negative
I have had a hard time with cell phones I never wanted to pay for a screen protecter and I pai the price by having my nice phones look horrible from scratches This Zagg screen protecter has kept my phone scratch free and looking good ,negative
The product works as advertised When I placed it on my phone it went on slightly to the side and I wasnt able to move itThis has kept it from fully sticking to the phone Make sure you put it on straight ,positive
Based on everything that I had read concerning this screen protector I wasnt sure if I was going to like it I purchased it knowing about the halo affect so I cant complain about that and everything else appears to be fine ,positive
The shield works well preventing my S7 from cracks Came unglued at edge glad I paid for it to be replaced that saved me big Only drawback is you have to tap the screen harder and sometimes multipule times ,positive
This shield protector is one of the most amazing things Ive ever encountered It literally deflected a nail gun nail and left the phone screen intact without a nick or a scratch and possibly prevented me from getting injured ,negative
I just love this clear glass shield on my phoneMy fingers just glide easily across the screenand the appearance is enhanced by its clarity making my phone much easier to read do my business ,positive
The zag screen cover is great I dropped my phone face down on a concrete floor and and it wasnt damaged at all That being said the price was pretty high for the product plus Best Buy charged to install it ,positive
This shield is great for protecting your phones glass from shattering I see so many phones that have cracked glass on them I actually dropped my phone which I never do and the shield cracked not my phone It is truly a phone saver ,negative
Great product I bought it for my teenage son that continually drops his phone and while the product cracked it protected the phone I believe they will also send you a new one if you are registered ,negative
I had Zagg sheilds on phonmes in the past and appreciated the way they prevented finferprints and smudges This HD Glass version is even better as it adds a thicker layer that protects the scrren to a greater degree ,negative
was told it was the best unfortunately the product was the opposite for me gave the product a week to settleform on the edges of phone screen lifted on both outer edges of phone instead of the latter ,negative
This screen protector is overall pretty good The only problem is that it doesnt curve with the edges of the galaxy s7 screen which leaves an unattached 18 section on both sides But to me thats not a big issue ,negative
The invisible shield is of great quality It is easily applied to the screen even by a novice It is clear and provides good visibility to your phone screen It has provided amazing protection to my phone screen ,positive
definitely not thrilled with the way this fits the phone it does not cover the entire screen therefore leaving a gap and the edges dont stay sealed to screen It was a waste of money for me as I ended up just taking it off ,negative
We never buy a phone without having a Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector installed before we leave Best Buy They do a great job of installing it and the Shield does a great job of protecting the screen of your new phone ,positive
Pleased with this for the most part Only thing I dislike is the sides dont stay down completely That might be due to operator error upon putting the protector on the phone did it myself But its not too bad Overall a good buy ,negative
My wife is rough with her phone Needless to say this replacement is worth it rather than paying for the phone replacement or repair that would have happened if it hadnt been there Nice save ,negative
As expensive as phones are I feel like I cant afford to not protect the screen Although a bit pricey this screen protector fits the bill and has a warranty should it ever be damaged or fail I would definitely recommend ,negative
I have always put zagg glass protectors on all of my phones and they have always kept my screen in mint condition Even though it leaves a slight border on both sides of the screen due to the new design It still protects the phone ,negative
Looks great when you first install it but it cracks very easy and looks bad They say they will will replace it but what a pain to go through there process I would rather buy another brand and get on with my life ,negative
This protection has saved the screen on my phone from damage many times It is much better to damage the protector than damage the touch screen Best Buy is truly THE BEST GREAT support and the Geek Squad is truly World Class ,negative
I always choose Zagg not only for their reliable product but for the awesome lifetime warranty that goes with it If the glass screen cracks simply contact them for a replacement You pay shipping only Cant beat that ,positive
The glass protector received cracks in it pretty easily only had for 2 months I will be sending back to replace not sure how well the process will go yet Will only recommend as a result of the ease of replacing for a new one ,positive
Have always used Zagg screen protectors Great warranty and customer service This particular screen protector however doesnt go with the curvature of the screen very well though Not a big deal when you have a case though ,positive
It seemed easy enough to put on and is clear and has no problems with the touch pad working but in trying to get out a bubble as per the instructions the edge shattered Will try to get another ,positive
Works fine but I feel that I have to put extra pressure around the sides and bottom when using keyboard or any touch function Samsung S7 is beveled around the screen edges so I feel they could make a protective screen to match ,positive
I purchased this product to protect my phone as I had broken the screen on my last phone This phone fell from counter height striking the base of a stool The Zagg cracked but my screen didntnew Zagg on my phone now ,negative
This was a replacement purchase When i contacted Zagg I received excellent service and they replaced the replacement with no shipping charge because of the issue I originally purchased the replacement at Best Buy ,negative
Although the Zagg screen protectors are quite expensive they are well worth the money My phone inevitably hits the ground at least a half dozen times a week but with my Zagg protection I have never had a screen shatter ,negative
Very expensive for a single piece but this is what my daughter wanted Did not fit the S7 normal very wellthe edges were not tight It will work which gets a star but sheesh no ,negative
We went through several of these before finally giving up Just the slightest little jar would begin to crack the screen protector It did protect the screen but we had to go back to the store to exchange every week or 2 ,negative
This is my second screen protector Great at protecting from dirt and scratches Theres a halo on the edges on my S7 not the Edge but combined with a protective case its saved my phone numerous times A must have for sure ,negative
I am sure there are cheaper options out there but it was for my teenage sons phone and I needed something I knew would work well We have had for a couple months so far and several drops late its still staying strong ,positive
doesnt grip the edges put on 2x by geek squad and the product is not what it should be for the pricealready cracking at the top and by the menu button with no dropping of the phone ,positive
I had it installed by Geek Squad when i bought it Within an hour the very edges on the sides came up about 116 in from the outside edge A few chips have come off since then Phone has been in a case since i bought it ,negative
This is a replacement purchase The 1st one had many cracks I was leaning toward a different screen protector but this was the only one available in store It was over half off so Im giving it a second chance ,negative
Bought two for our new S7s Think the product is better than the earlier vinyl version we had on our LG G2s Bought another one for the S2 Galaxy Tablet So easy to put on I did it myself and avoided GEEK Squad costs ,positive
Bought mine about a month ago and it has already starting developing pit marks The edges are coming off They want me to pay for another one so the warranty is useless Wasted my money on this one No more Zagg for me ,negative
The samsung phone is curved and the edges of the screen protector dont stick down and is mildly annoying Its like a ring around the collar But after a few days you wont even notice anymore ,negative
This glass screen protector was highly recommended by the sales associate and after having it for more than two weeks now I can definitely say that it works great It doesnt smudge and there are still no scratchesI like it ,positive
I like how the protector covers the original phone screen However It is slightly larger than the screen and debris will collect on the edge of the screen However I also could not register this product on its website ,positive
Im a klutz and the glass screen protector takes the hit instead of my phone The only time it hasnt worked was when I was too lazy to put it on Unlimited exchanges for 7 a piece included shipping ,negative
This is the first Zagg product I have owned that doesnt fit right It is too wide and leaves a slight dead zone near the left and right edges Im almost hoping it comes off soon so I can replace it with another brand ,positive
had trouble with previous protectors due to the curved edges of the screen This protector does not extend all the way to the edge so stays in place better and doesnt get pulled loose by a case ,negative
Zagg screen protectors are great I only have one issue with this screen protector and that is it doesnt fit the screen correctly due to the curvature of the screen so the outside edges dont completely seal like they should ,positive
I really did not like this product Had it for a week it had already cracked without me ever dropping it Got it replaced and within 3 days it had cracked again I just gave up at that point and asked for a refund ,negative
I liked the thickness of the shield The reason I gave it a 4 star is it doesnt fit the Samsung Galaxy S7 properly The edge of the phone curves and the shield does not bend So to me it doesnt fit the phone correctly ,positive
After getting one crack on the screen protector it has done a great job of protecting the screen on my phone I like that it does not chip away when it does get broken into it is pretty durable and reliable for the most part ,positive
I like the protection this screen protector offers but I do not like the bubbled edges Maybe the associate that installed it simply put it on wrong but it looks ugly with a lifted bubbled look all the way around the edges ,positive
I have owned ZAGG protectors in the past and they were great then and remain great The 7 has a slight roll on the long sides and unfortunately this protector doesnt exactly conform so there is a little gap down both sides ,positive
I think I need a better phone case to protect the screen saver Ive purchased two of these and both of them have chipped when Ive dropped the phone But I think a phone case that protects it would help solve the problem ,positive
Seems good but is already popping off my screen Edges dont go all the way down best buy employee who put it on said thats normal I dont know if its an issue with the product or with the guy who installed it ,positive
Prior to getting the Zagg invisibleShield my 6 year old dropped the phone at minute maid park while watching you tube and not the Astros The glass lens cracked We are looking forward to the added protection for her new phone ,negative
Yes the glass protection breaks fairly easily with any drop of the phone but it beats your phone screen breaking Love that its life time warranty so when the screen does break you can replace it for free ,negative
Had an issue with screen shield cracking after fews days on phone It wasnt dropped not sure what caused it to crack on side of screen Zagg was contacted sending free replacement so going to try shield again ,negative
Only had protect screen about 2wksprotectscreen alrdy has several chips on it it very clser doesnot tk away from phn screen easy to swipegreat purchasewish would hv brought b4 i crack my phn screen ,positive
I hate these glass protectors It easily chipped on the side Im going back to using wet apply screen protectors I never had a problem with them ,negative
This was the only screen protector the store had available for my phone It is very clear and you wouldnt know that its there but mine developed a crack in the corner a day after it was put on at the time of purchase ,positive
With phones having so many uses in so many areas it is easy to put the phone in harms way and therefore protection is needed to preserve the phone from damage This helps… ,negative
Does not fit the S7 Edges did not get even close to sealing causing it shield to Crack on the edges on day 2 of minimal use Also making it near impossible to use touchscreen on phone without great seal ,negative
Id recommend using Geek Squad for placing shield on the phone after purchase but other than that this shield fits and works fine so far on my Samsung S7 phone Fingers crossed when it drops ,positive
Put this screen on a day after i got my phone the next day i dropped it and it bounced between my tool box and work bench before it hit the ground the cover screen spidered and saved my phonewell worth it ,positive
My wife had this protector installed free over the glass of her phone at Best Buy She loves it is so clear with no bubbles like with most screen protectors You also get a lifetime warranty so you cant go wrong ,positive
I dropped my phone the screen saver cracked in 2 places I had registered it so it was 100 covered Had a new screen cover in 48 hours Best Buy charge 8 to put it on Be sure to register your screen saver ,positive
Ill only purchase Zagg screen protectors Best on the market Lifetime warranty Been using them since my Blackberry days lol Have it installed by a Best Buy employee to prevent frustration ha Great product 5 stars ,negative
I hesitated before buying a screen protector for my new phone as earlier products were difficult to apply This thing attached in seconds with no troubles getting the bubbles out and no debris under it ,negative
Love zagg glass screen protectors Only thing with this one is the phone is slightly curved on the edges its not an edge phone its the correct protector Got a crack on the edge of the screen 1 week later ,negative
Huge fan of invisasheild glass however this one is not made for the phone and its slight curve design not its not for the edge so there is lift on edges So it doesnt have proper fit I hope they redesign soon ,positive
The cost of 40 dollars seems excessive at first glance but when you realize if you register the product you can replacements cheap as heck So if you have the money up front go for it If not cheaper alternatives do exist ,negative
Invisishield Glass is fantastic Have it on all my devices as well as my familys devices It has saved so much money in replacements for phones If it cracks or any defect will be replaced for free by the company ,positive
This is the best screen protector available It is worth the money because if you happen to damage it it is only 5 to replace instead of Ahaving to replace your phone or B having to buy a whole new screen protector ,positive
This product is easy to apply yourself and gives your screen all around protection from side to side and top to bottom Product is clear and easy to see thru and made thick enough for great screen protection ,positive
This isnt well built for the Samsung Galaxy S7 because it doesnt sit correctly on the side due to how they angle This causes it to look beveled Its not a big deal but a little annoying It seems good otherwise ,positive
Bought an open box Had fuzz on protector that was not removable therefore recommend buying new and never removing until you are ready to replace ,positive
The screen is curved a little bit and the screen protector is flat Their for within a few days of installing the edges were all cracked wish the associate would have mentioned that would happen ,negative
But the best thing about this glass breaking is that theres not gon na be a rattlesnake at the end of it But for real this glass is gon na break before the glass on your phone is gon na break and thats its job isnt it ,negative
Feels like nothing is on my screen which is great Paid to have it installed and the guy at Best Buy put it on perfectly Just a little expensive at 40 but Im happy with it Works well with my Tech21 clear case too ,positive
This was recommended by the Samsung rep when I got my Galaxy S7 I previously had another brand on my iPhone and could never see the screen in the sun just overall didnt like it this one however I highly recommend ,positive
Worth every penny Zagg is the best dropped my phone a few times and screen was unscathed Love Zaggs warranty replace a scratched or damaged cover for life for the cost of shipping cant beat it ,negative
Bought the best cover for my new phone was told there would be some Haloing around the edgesdidnt think it would look this badSad dont buy this expensive shield buy the cheaper zagg for the GS7 ,positive
It was an ok screen protector not even for a week I got the galaxy S7 so needed a screen protector Did a same day purchase Screen Started to chip from the edges which I have not neglected the phone ,negative
Have been using this product for years and never have had a cracked screen Accidents happen and the phone has been dropped and the shield has always protected the phone I would not own a phone without this product ,negative
Disappointed in this shield My prevous Zagg shields have lasted me years this one is already cracking along the edges Purchased one for my daughter as well and hers is also chipping and cracking along the edge ,positive
This is the best samsung cover Others ive tried always have come off Great protection this has always kept the phone from cracking and scratching upon dropping and stays on great ,positive
Edges dont stick to the screen and chiped on that area scratches easily and all that in less then 30 days and this is the second one they put on because the first one had even a lager area it wouldnt stick to ,negative
My daughter told new about this product and how good it was on her IPhone so I got one for my new S7 so far so good Could fit a little better not as big as the screen itself but with the case I got it works fine ,positive
The Zagg screen protectors saved my last phone screen from shattering so there was no question I would add it to my new phone I recommend everyone gets one because its inevitable that you drop your phone ,negative
I like to place my phone in my back pocket I like to know it has a shield on This product works very well A low priced insurance policy Real clear and assures me my trade in value will be higher A must have ,positive
Good screen protector I have not had any problems with scratches cleans easily Only problem I have had are little chips at the side because it does not curve to conform to the edge of my screen ,negative
This product does not properly for the galaxy s7 I bought it and had it placed on by the store and it doesnt adhere to the side around the entire screen It sometimes makes pushing enter or search and delete difficult ,negative
Love zahgs products first off But on this particulas model for the GS7 the glass doeant bevel with screen causing a halo on the edges Second one in 1 month Chips on edges where not beveled Hope they correct this ,positive
I have had e few of these on my phones and I have to say they are a screen saver Went to a concert dropped my phone this protector broke and my phone didnt Would have to say this is well worth buying ,positive
I have no complaints about my screen protectorI did have to get it replaced cause somebody dropped something on my phone a chipped it but it didnt harm my actual screen It was replaced free A great smooth surface ,positive
The protector is very clear The protection is supposed to be good I saw similar products work well on other phones Having the lifetime warranty helps since the protector is supposed to crack a lot when impacted ,positive
My daughter cracked her screen so this is more of Bandaid than a true protector but it is containing the crack so she can continue to use the phone until we can afford to replace it ,negative
A little pricey especially at this that this for an S7 and Samsung is now on 9 I was anticipating some kind of discount Mother than that it ’ s and very clear ,negative
Ive bought this twice on my s7 and both times it hasnt sealed properly on the sides I dont think it ever will for anyone Dust gets in there and its very grody and then it breaks easier on the sides ,positive
I do like how this product feels and cleans well due to the glass Very durable but will crack with enough impact Warranty comes with easy replacement just pay the shipping Pretty easy to install as well ,positive
This screen protector sticks up at the edges due to the slightly curved screen of the S7 not edge Has already cracked up and down the sides of the screen protector on my device in less than a month ,negative
Halo around the entire screen protector never went away Started breaking a few days after I had the Best Buy employee place it now in pieces and the adhesive is the only thing holding it together ,negative
I love having this screen protector Bought it because dust kept getting under the screen protector that was on my otter box case Dont have that problem with this at all Would definitely buy again ,negative
Unfortunately the form factor comes up a bit short and allows the sticky edges of this screen protector to morph into a pocket lint and dust magnet and the lint can not be removed as it becomes attached to the glue ,negative
It does its job to protect the screen and warranty replacement is super simple Only reason for 4 stars is even though it is the right one for my phone the fit at the edges is not great ,positive
The shield attached to cell face as directed Ended up buying an OtterBox to protect the cell phone from drops Removed the glass shield as the screen sensitivity was somewhat reduced ,positive
36 hrs after we bought it it was already protecting the brand new phone My son hit it with a baseball The shield showed the web like cracking But it was only the protector The only draw back 1 in a box for 44 ,positive
I have used this one prior cell phones and it has always been great sadly the glass cover is slightly smaller than the actual screen area resulting in a lack of sensitivity at the left and right edges of the display ,negative
Insalled by best buy on the day of purchase Edges immediately cracked Best Buy refused to take it back and had nothing better to replace it with It was a completely adverse experience at Worst Buy ,negative
It protects the screen however the side edges dont quite fit The phone has a rounded edge and the screen doesnt so it looks like it doesnt sit on the edge and makes it easy to crack Mine cracked in my pocket ,negative
I love the glass screen protectors but have always had the staff help me with installation I ordered this online so chose to install it myself It was super easy to do and looks like a professional did it ☻ ,positive
I always get these for my phones as I am prone to putting my phone into bags with loads of other things I carry around They do a great job protecting the screen and the replacement policy is amazingly easy too ,positive
This was the flat glass version Even the regular S7 is slightly curved at the edges This allows dirt to get under the edges Zagg has a newer one that follows the edge at a higher price ,negative
I ought this for my Samsung S8 I wound up taking this back to the store because it started coming off of my screen I dont think it works well with the curved screen But it was easy to put on ,positive
Hands down this is a must purchase for any cellphone Ive had it on my phone and dropped it I thought my screen was shattered but only the screen protector was shattered Saved me from replacing a screen ,negative
I have dropped my S5 many times face down and the Zagg tempered glass shield saved the day When I bought my S7 once again I installed the Zagg tempered glass shield it is the cheapest insurance you will ever buy ,positive
Great screen protector but because my galaxy s7s edges curve back slightly the sides of the screen protector dont cover the side edges of the phone Now theres lint collecting on the edges of my cell ,negative
Bought it on the recommendation of the Best Buy sales associate It has no negative impact on the performance of the phone makes me more confident that I wont trash my screen the next time I drop my new phone ,negative

This is a terrible product that does not function properly Screen protector does not seal around the edges of the phone and allows for debris to get under the protector Do not buy this product for the regular S7 ,negative
This is a good screen protector but the edges are not stuck down so I have to push harder when tapping near the edges Im not sure if the edges will pull up the whole screen after a time ,negative

I was told that the glass option of the protector would be the better option It holds up well however you can see every scratch on it unlike my previous vinyl ones Plus it does fit well along the edges ,positive
This product is not good The S7yes not s7 edge curves slightly at the edges while this screen protector is flat which causes it to flare around the edges and not lay flat on screen Does not look good at all ,positive

I have a 2 year old son he has dropped my phone MANY times There are two or three tiny little scratches on the shield now No cracks no damage to the phone So not perfect but a pretty darn good product ,negative

The Zagg glass shield for the Galaxy S7 is great It does have that halo effect around the edges because the glass is sightly curves on the s7 but its still does its job and looks prettty good ,positive
These screen protectors crack way too easily The halo around the edges are kind of annoying They do their job so your screen doesnt crack but really annoying to warranty them every month or so ,negative
I find this shield to work well on the Samsung Galaxy S7 phone It is light weight so doesnt add bulk unlike the thicker glass shield I used on my old iPhone It does exactly what it is supposed to do ,positive
There is a small frame around all edges that does not secure to the phone so its noticeable when phone is off Geek squad installed said its due to slight curve on edges of phone ,positive

I like the way this product protects the screen on my Android but I need to keep replacing it because cracks always develop I have lifetime warranty but must pay 7 for shipping each time ,negative
I have these installed on all of my phones and wont even use a new phone until it is added I can not say I drop my phone often but these definitely help protect the screen I recommend these to everyone ,positive
The phone has a natural curvature and the film would not lay flat and was lifted throughout all its edges I will never buy this again I didnt even get a weeks worth of use Waste of money ,positive

Protect your Samsung Galaxy S7 device with this InvisibleShield glass screen cover Featuring fortified tempered glass construction this cover defends against scratches to extend your screen ’ s life ,negative
My screen protector I had didnt cover the whole screen and made touching the edge very hard now I have this one that has the ever so slightly curve to match my phone and edge touching is how it should be ,negative
This is my second oneIt is protective but tends to take on cracks fairly easilyThe phone screen itself does not get damaged which is its purpose ,negative
Not exactly sure what the issue istwo attempts by sales person and mine still did not seal properly on edges and is already cracked on a corner without having been dropped or mishandled ,negative
This screen cover offers exactly whay I expect from Zagg a very clear durable screen protector at a reasonable price I was pleased to purchase it and the salesman was kind enough to apply it ,positive
There is no contest The Zagg glass screen protector is the best on the market I have had it on a couple of my phones now and hope they will always make them for whatever phone I get in the future ,positive

I have bought 2 of these and they cracked within a day or two each time It says that it has a lifetime warranty and I registered When I tried to do a vlaim it says I am not recognized ,negative
Does not hug the slight curves at the edges of an s7 Would be better if it was sized smaller Since purchasing there are already cracks along the perimeter It does offer scratch protection ,positive
Doesnt fit the phone even though its for an S7 Zagg is supposedly making a Glass Contour but it isnt out yet Dont know why this one was ever made ,negative
On the edges of the glass they do not stick due to the phones screen being somewhat curved So after a couple days it gets dust and its not very attractive and rather annoying Just a heads up ,negative
I have purchased ZAGG previously and this one offers great protection for my S7 screen The instructions make it easy to apply the protector to your phone and you can barely notice it ,positive
1st one chipped in less than 24 hours Cost 599 for sh to replace Does not fit flush on my phone screen Best Buy cant help me even though I bought an 800 phone and all accessories there ,negative
I like the idea of protecting my screen which the product has done numerous times but I certainly hate paying 6 for shipping when I need a replacement protector But the product alone is awesome ,positive

It does a very good job I like the product It helps keep the screen from breaking which my daughter has done many time on her phone So I would recommend this product to anyone with a cell phone ,positive
The shield chipped within 24 hours and then the replacement has now chipped Zagg products are terrible but they unfortunately seem to be the only option…there is a reason they offer free replacements ,negative
I love the protection of the screen The only downside is that the thickness of the screen protector does not cover all of the screen and sometimes I have to hit a button a couple times to go through ,positive
We have used this excellent product before on our 2 old cell phones We really like this screen cover glad it was recommended to us 2 yrs ago by your Best Buy rep at our nearby store ,positive
I balked at the price of my invisishield however it did a great job at saving my screen from cracking I would rather pay the sh fee for a new screen saver than buy a whole new screen for my phone ,positive
I have bought these particular invisible shields for every phone I had This one isnt really good because the edge of the protector wont seal It leaves a shadow when you are looking at your phone ,negative
The first time I accidently set my phone face down on a hard surface the glass protector cracked Maybe it hit something just right I am about to use their lifetime warranty hopefully that goes well ,negative
Product is durable and keeps my phone secure from any damage Have used Zagg protective covers for years and always find the product reliable ,positive
I ’ ve enjoyed the screen protector on all my IPhones Just wipe and screen is clear and the protection it offers is well worth the money Love the replacement element also ,positive
I purchased this screen protector for my s7 since I dont change phones very often and my previous one was on a galaxy note II5 years old andthe screen never got a scratch on itprice is great ,negative
This is easy to apply and privides excellent protection for my phone I also love that this product is warrantied and the company will replace it for the cost of postage if it gets damaged ,positive
Broke within a few months and then I realized that I had to pay shipping to get it replaced despite the inital higher price and included lifetime warranty ,negative
ive used this brand before and have been impressed but this one doesnt adhere around the whole edge and has already started chipping from less than 3 drops otherwise its been good ,positive
At first I got a faulty glass screen but once I spoke to Zang customer service THEY TOOK CARE OF IT They over night a new screen and best buys Geek Squad put it together BEST PORTECTOR EVER ,negative
We are so glad that we bought this product to protect our phone It is so easy to wipe off and come cleanProtects the face of your phoneCant go wrong on spending the money on this product ,positive
Even though this is the screen made to fit the Samsung S7 it does NOT fit correctly It will not seal correctly It just comes up around the edges Best Buy Geek Squad applied 3 of them ,positive
This is a bit hard to apply correctly but does a great job protecting the phone Lifetime replacement is wonderful We have already gotten one replaced since our ballistic case did not do its job ,positive
Well this is my third Zagg shield Each time I have to pay 8 to have it replaced Not made for Samsung 7 fit over the edges The screen slants and the shield doesnt fit ,negative
Everything is great except for the fit on the edges for the screen it does not quite conform the slite curve of the screen it allows a small space for dirt and dust to collect ,negative
Boy do I wish I would of read the reviews before I bought this screen saverI edges dont fit the screen and I can see it being pulled off the screen and breaking not impressed at all ,negative
Looked OK for a bit but has chips on the edges in a few places this with a case and being put in a pocket in my purse BB applied it so not an error on my part for putting it on wrong ,negative
I found everything that i wss looking for The people were very help and pleasent to talked to The prices were right in line with other stores The store was very clean I will be back ,positive
Should have read reviews Does not sit flush on face due to bezel of phone case leads to the shield cracking at the inside corners around the camera lense as well as the home button ,positive
The Zagg screen protector is simply and added bonus and a smart necessity to owning a new and fairly highdollar S7 cell phone It make s me feel much better to have than not have it ,positive
Got a really good price at BB and the associate did a nice job installing it Zagg took a beating on a different phone but kept the phone like new The free replacement program worked well ,positive
This is the second screen protector from this company that i used and I swear a day after I bought my phone I hit it against something and the screen protector did its job I love this product ,positive
This is a must have for me Wish it covered the whole glass of the screen Weird air pockets showup after Best Buy Mobile rep installs them This time it took 6090 days to show the bubbles ,negative
Have these on all my mobile phones They work great Have saved my screen from breaks many times Have had the glass protectors replaced via warranty thru Zagg with zero issues many times ,negative
I have purchased this for multiple devices and those that have broken have been replaced with ease keeping the screen of the phone protected and safe from wear Definitely worth the money ,positive
Very easy to install Simply press on Invisible and provides scratch protection to the screen Have not had a drop yet so unsure how protective it would be Good value 1899 ,positive
Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 I have bought one of these for every smart phone that Ive had and never had a problem until now this doesnt fit like it should ,positive
Did not like the fact that it required more pressure on the touch screen to activate whats the screen protector was applied I took it off shortly after and replaced it with a less rigid one ,negative
Dont buy this one and its not Best buy its Zagg They make a curved screen protector that will not bubble Buy that instead They manager at the store out this on excellent though ,positive
After being told by a BB employee this is the best out there it cracked in the first week on the edges While it has a replacement option I havent had the time to deal with that yet ,negative
I try to be really carefully with any of my electronics but lets be honestaccidents happen I have dropped my phone and couple of times and this has protected my phone amazingly well ,positive
Zagg is a very good glass screen protector Looks just like the screen with no protection Screen crisp and clear and easy to clean To my surprise doesnt leave many fingerprints at all ,positive
I love Zagg they stick by their products and honor their agreements I love the fact that it has a lifetime warranty from this day forward I will only buy Zagg screen covers to protect my phone ,positive
Although I think Best Buy could come up with a better way for installation ie mobile should apply rather than Geek Squad this product is one of the best screen protectors available ,positive
This is my second purchase i had the first sheild for 1 year i treat my phone rough the sheild cracked but my phone was intact Had to to get the same protection ,negative
Zagg protectors are usually good but this one is not It ruins the touch of the phone so you have to bang on the keys and even then you may have to hit the keys around the edge more than once ,negative
This is a great protective device for my phone This will help to ensure that I will a good clear screen that will be protected from scratching and can be easily cleaned ,positive
I really like zagg but they dropped the ball on this one The screw protector doesnt cover the how screen For some reason on the edges it doesnt completely stick Kind of a waster of 40 dollara ,positive
Ive had many phones and always use a screen protector This is the first time its ever broken Within the first month of getting it So Im a bit disappointed to be honest Good luck ,negative
I bought this to protect my s7 While I think it did its job protecting my screen it seemed to happen quickly Im not sure it its ultra sensitive or I had something pushing against my screen ,positive
The glass screen protector already cracked and chips on the edges It did it with my last phone also It is however better than the old school ones that you needed to replace every month ,negative
The glass doesnt curve to the edges so you get cracks pretty easy The only saving grace is the free replacements The only thing is you still have to pay or shipping ,positive
Purchased a cheaper screen protector initially and was a waste of money This one has no bubbles is easy to clean and has a lifetime warranty Will not hesitate to purchase for future phones ,positive
AT first I was uneasy getting screen protector but once Best Buy put it on I was supper content So far I love this item no issues what so ever I highly recommend this product ,negative
The screen protector does its job but Im not highly satisfied with it It doesnt seem like it fits the phone completely It didnt mold to the screen fully ,positive

This glass screen protector saved my screen on numerous occasionsOne bad thing though it didnt fit very well It didnt fit my dads either ,negative
Would you like to have a cell phone with a damaged screen thats permanent or know that a fix is available to prevent this in the first place Its a no brainer as to what you should do ,positive
The screen on the Galaxy 7 is pretty touch but the added protection is worth the small price The screen is easy to clean does not interfere with the touch screen capabilities of the phone ,positive
Easy to apply Edges dont stay down when cover is put on but once the cover is on you dont notice it once its on Works perfect dropped phone many times with no issues ,negative
Chipped the first day I got it then cracked and now has a huge crack all across the screen protector Went to look for a replacement on the site and the product page says nothat available ,negative
These are the best screen protectors in my opinion and the only ones I use the edges can get lifted sometimes if used with certain cases I never get a new phone without getting a Zagg ,positive
I have always used Zagg products but this one is just all wrong Leaves a halo around the edge of the screen since the screen is slightly curved and the glass is not ,negative
This is a great screen protector has saved the screen on my phone many times Best Buy does great job putting it on too ,positive
Definitely worth the money for this glass screen protector Easy to keep clean and feels great when using your phone unlike the plastic screen protectors ,positive
My wife and I have these on our phones You can not beat the warranty from ZAGG Weve used their products on our S5s and S7s and have never broken our screens ,negative
Purchasing another Zagg was a must Weve used these products for years now and any time theres a need for an exchange its quick and simple Would never use another screen protector ,negative
I have been overall pleased with this screen protector with one exception You have to press a little harder than you normally would with a pliable protector Other than thatits all good ,positive
Every cell computer tablet that requires some type of computer screen protector I highly recommend Zagg It gets cracked broken I pay a small fee and get it replaced SO worth it ,negative
I really like this cover It is very clear and smooth to the touch My only complaint is that you have to push a little harder on your screen I guess due to the thickness of the glass ,positive
It cracked in two places first week i had it but i would rather it crack than my screen to crack Even though it wasnt 30 days best buy made me go through the manufacturer to get a replacement ,negative
Just be aware that this Zagg product does not completely seal on the edges of the S7 due to the curvature of the phone Does allow some dust to find its way under the glass ,negative
Screen shields help keep expensive phone screens from getting scratched andor broken and in my case keep sweat from staining the original screen lol ,negative
Although a little pricey it is well worth it I cracked my last screen protector and gother a new one for the price of shipping Bought another one for my new phone Well worth the money ,positive
This screen protector seems to be working ok my main issue with it seems to easily separate from the phone around the edges Not sure the adhesive is the issue or something else ,negative
I would not recomended It leaves a halo affect on the edges of phone I was told this is normal Concerned with dirt specs getting in between film and phone where the halo is ,negative
My wife hates the bulky protectors and just can not use them in small purses This screen protection is exactly what she needed ,negative
Was recommended this product from associates Terrible product would never buy again Not worth the money Scratches easily I have used much cheaper products that have worked much better ,positive
With the ZAGG glass Ive always used the Zagg film protector before and loved it I was skeptical about the glass but it works great with no effect on the screen image and resolution ,positive
The screen protector does not lay flat on the screen as the screen is curved Ended up contacting Zagg and getting their curved version Zagg was very helpful and great services ,positive
This glass cover has not impacted performance Only wish it was curved at the edges to match the actual glass The new version comes curved ,negative
It definitely protects your screen Make sure you put it on a time with no interruptions The company does honor their product by sending a new one and then you must return the old one ,negative
Although the glass screen protector goes on great with no bubbles it seems to be very delicate Ionly had mine 12 days before a corner cracked somehow Big perk is the lifetime warranty ,positive
So far I havent been to impressed with this screen protector It bubbles on the side so it doesnt look very neat It has chipped already just from sitting down hard on hard surface ,negative
This Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector is super clear and fits perfectly In my case it is the extra protection I need and easily wipes clean with the provided cloth ,positive
Im not sure if the screen protector breaks easier then the phone screen But Ill take replacing the life time free replacement protector over paying 150 to replace the actual screen ,positive
I found it difficult to install correctly on my phone and I still have some bubbles places where it doesnt adhere completely Not much better than a standard screen protector IMO ,positive
Easy installation took minutes to complete great protection civers entire screen with holes for camera no problems reading my touch no issues at all I am very pleased with this product ,positive
Easy to attach The design of the phone makes it difficult to use on edges so I placed this to the inside edge as far as I could ,negative
Good quality but unfortunately once you apply it on the phone both sides will stick out a little I wish they designe it little curve on both sides so it would fit perfectly ,negative
Very impressed with the quality of this glass screen protector I love that it has a lifetime warranty If the phone drops the protector is supposed to crack instead of your screen ,positive
I upgraded from Samsung Galaxy 5 I find the battery power much better with this phone unless Im using media such as YouTube or listening to music I find the picture quality the same ,positive
I love that the screen protector is not attached to the case You dont even notice its on there Just be careful because if you do drop your phone you can crack the screen protector ,negative
Im disappointed that they would make it without even a slight curve to match the S7 not S7 Edge So when I put it on the edges didnt stay with the curvature of the screen ,negative
The screen protector is ok Easy to install yourself Its stick down almost automatically However the edges down not stick like the rest of the screen Being glass it does not bend ,positive
this product has already broke in the first week of having it I have not got it fixed yet because of time and will I have to pay an amount to fix it It is a crack on the screen ,negative
Its glass that sits on your glass screen I had one in the past and when I dropped my phone it broke and not the screen Much cheaper investment and if you register it its warrantied ,negative
I have used this for a few months now It was put on my phone and then covered with an OtterBox Defender case Dropped once zero damage Screen still looks as new as the first day ,negative
We had a family member have a screen break and we had this installed to protect the new screen and it is clearer than the plastic one we had installed when we bought the phone ,positive
Not pleased with the way it fits went through a couple of them before I got one that fit without any air bubbles It recently chipped so I wont be buying this type of screen protector again ,positive
We were told by the store clerk that this protector was the best one on the market After talking to the product service we knew that this was the best advice to help protect our phones ,positive
Im very rough with my phones so I bought this because I thought it would work Needless to say within a week it was already cracked Good thing they offer a warranty with it ,negative
This Android Phone Glass Screen Protector is a very heavy duty material to prevent any damages scratches HIGHLY RECOMMEND ,negative
Love this screen protector Its smooth like the screen would be with out a protector Also has a lifetime warranty if it cracks all you have to do is pay for shipping ,positive
This is the second one of these that Ive bought Each one has cracked within the first 24 hours of having it The edges do not seal properly to the phone which causes the issue ,negative
Zagg makes great screen protectors for the Samsung phone its scratch resistant strong and easy to clean I would buy this brand again ,positive
This is my second one both had the same problem Within just a few days i had chips on the outside edges Everything else works fine but for the price this should not be an issue ,negative
The lifetime warranty is amazing Yes Ive dropped my phone a few times and had to replace the screen saver For close to 5 they send me a new one everytime ,positive
No scratches or dings on my phone but the protected has lips on either side that wont stick down all the way so it gets dirty in between protector and phone Otherwise its pretty good ,negative
With an active lifestyle my phone sees extraordinary wear and tear This glass shield maintains a great display and keeps my phone looking and operating like new ,positive
It is very protective for your screen Best there is However the s7 has a small dip around outside of screen that the shield can not cover due to its rigidness It creates a halo effect ,negative
Love it it makes me feel very safe with it on Do not worry about cracking my screen I had the store salesperson put it on for me to be sure of a perfect fit ,positive
we had tried other brands and they came off after 2 days We purchased this ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 and its been working great ,positive
This protector is too large for the S7 It is not an edge but still has curved sides The protector does not mine cracked the first day I had it because the edges didnt curve down ,negative
a complete protection for your touchscreen The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because of the price and for some reason the edges do not seem to be completely sticking to the phone ,positive
I have already dropped my phone a couple of times and this has saved my screen from shattering This paired with the Otterbox case is almost a 100 full proof from ever damaging your phone ,negative
I am uncertain how this screen cover compares to a plastic one as I am easy on my phones However I can tell you that it doesnt affect the sensitivity of the screen and it is very clear ,positive
Love the tempered glass screen protectors they have saved me so much money and insurance claims over the past few years I would never buy a phone that zagg does not make a protector for ,negative
Really wished it fit over the whole screen I was told zagg was the best but I have nor found one that covers the whole screen otherwise is the best I have had but is a little pricey ,positive
I like the slim design yet solid construction of this smartphone protector The smooth finish allows me to slide it in and out of my pocket with ease yet its not too slippery ,positive

Samsung threw a curve with the standard Galaxy S7 Like the S6 the S7 looks flat but unlike the S6 the S7 screen has is a slight curve down on the edges Zagg has established a great reputation for producing some of the best screen protectors out there This is why I purchased the Zagg Invisible Shield Glass which says on the box it is for the Galaxy S7 not Edge but it will not fit properly Because of the slight curve of the S7 screen at the edges the Glass screen protector can not adhere to the edge leaving a halo effect about one eighth of an inch around the edges From my research I found this issue has been documented on the web since last spring Zagg no longer offers this screen protector for the S7 on their website yet they never recalled the millions of units still out there nor have they informed the retailers this item will not fit the S7 according to my Best Buy Associate Zagg now offers the Glass Curve for the S7 which Best Buy does not offer at this time However the screen protector only comes in BLACK The screen portion is clear with black opaque top and bottom that will cover the color portion of the phone Now if you have a standard black phone not a major issue If you have a colored phone the color of the phone is covered and you now have a black phone Also many have complained that the new Glass Curve makes the touch screen less sensitive requiring multiple swipes and harder pressure Others have complained the edge of the Glass Curve shield will eventually lift from the screenThere are pros and cons to using a screen protector with todays Gorilla Glass 4 As far as film type protectors I dont think they are necessary for todays screens as they reduce the quality of the screen touch and view and offer no real protection for screen breakage As for the Glass type protectors I do believe they offer protection for screen breakage while keeping the touch and view qualities of the screen In fairness to BB and Zagg BB offered to returnrefund and Zagg offered to replace with the new Curve Glass when available I bought my Zagg as part of an accessory bundle and if refunded I lose my discount on the other items in the bundle I do not want a BLACK screen protector and it is unknown if Zagg will produce a clear version of the Glass Curve The Invisible Shield Glass I have now functions feels right to the touch does not diminish the sensitivity of the screen and the halo on the edge is only noticeable when the screen has a dark image or is off I would only recommend this screen protector for the S7 if you can get it at an extreme discount as it will still protect I highly recommend the Invisible Shield Glass for any device it actually fits ,positive
Bought both the s7 and the Zagg InvisiSheild Glass Actually I bought two of the Zagg products but not because I wanted to Let me explain I bought the phone and screen protector though the screen protector was at a different store It was close by so i paid for it and picked it up I came home and attempted to install using the easy install tabs First when I followed the instructions and executed Step 2 Remove protective film at 1 icon the actual screen protector oilresistant nano coating and scratch resistant tempered glass layer had separated from the Premium screen protection layer and the adhesive I didnt realize this because the screen protector and the protective film were indistinguishable from each other After several attempts of installing the protectors glass adhesive layer not realizing the protector was already destroyed and useless because the main protection layer was not attached to the Glass and adhesive layers I kept noticing the edges wouldnt lay down In attempting to seal them I like several other reviewers ended up creating bubles in the main viewing area In the process of trying to correct that I ripped the adhesive layer and had no screen protection I went back to Best Buy thinking it was all my fault when in fact even if it had laid down good the product was defective in the box I bought a 2nd screen protector and this time I paid BestBuy to do it Its on but it doesnt look like it is You can see a gap between the s7s beveled edge and the flat screen protector My phone and screen protector are less than two days old and because of the edges of the protector not clinging to the edge of the device There are tons of dust and other stuff clinging to that edge of exposed adhesive and with part of the screen edge exposed does the screen protector actually provide the level of protection it is intended to Absolutely not This was a bad release period It feels like they took one of the other protectors for a flat phone and branded it for the s7 to avoid not having a product when the phone released while they try and fix it with a curved glass s7 model Im really hoping that Zagg will honor their Guarantee and fix this problem for me I have purchased Zagg protection for every device I have Tab s 2x s5 s7 2x Nooks etc In every situation with the exception of the Galaxy s7 I was thrilled with how the other Zagg products performed ease of installation and overall quality I installed them easily and without any bubbles on my 10 Tab S 9 Nooks and my s5s This s7 protector is not good ,positive
I used to go commando no screen protection and no caseuntil I dropped my fortunately very inexpensive and old Motorola phone 2ft onto the street as I was getting out of my car I cant tell you how many times Ive done that but this was the last drop The screen was completely destroyed Lucky me I was due for an upgrade Ultimately I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S7 normal style not the Edge For outer protection I picked up a TECH21 EVO Check case for which I did read reviewslots and lots of reviews and its perfect For the screen I bought this Zagg Glass Screen Protectorwithout reading reviews Even as I type this I still havent read what others are saying about it Instead I went on the recommendation from the Best Buy Employee At home excited to play with my new toy I applied the glass screen to my new phone I didnt have much trouble aligning it and the yellow peel this side off firstdont touch the adhesive side message was as clear and concise as could be Then came the disappointmentthe S7 has a slight curve to it and the glass shield did not lay flat on the left and right edges I could immediately see the potential for lint dust and funk to collect under this 18 lip on both sides I thought I installed it wrong So I got online registered my shield and then called Zagg for installation support After looking me up in their system and hearing my complaint the Zagg employee was quick to admit that this was a known problem She confirmed that I had in fact correctly installed the shield and then informed me that they have developed a shield to match my phone She further explained that Zagg had not yet pulled all units back from the sales floors and that they will replace my purchase for free After collectingconfirming my info she waived the shipping and mailed me via USPS the correct Glass Curve Shield model GS7CGCBK0 While there was no additional money out of my pocket the replacement took 29 days to arrive I couldnt find my replacement here on Best Buys website I have a feeling that Zagg still hasnt formally released it Heres my 4star review for thatPatience a steady hand perfect vision and a dust free environment is HIGHLY recommended for installation The Glass Curve Invisible Shield for the Samsung Galaxy S7 fits perfectly on all edges The bordertrim has a black finish that helps to hide the fact that you have a screen protector at all which I love However the symbols for the Home button and the Back button the white backlit capacitive buttons on the bottom left and right of the phone are covered by the glass shield and its black finish Etched through the black are the exact shapes for said buttons Any error in placement of the glass shield will coverup andor block the backlight from these buttons Applying this shield made me feel like the nervous bomb squad guy trying to cut the correct wire Steady Focus Easy now Easy As if worrying that I hadnt cleared the screen of finger prints and dust wasnt enough I was in a panic about correctly aligning the shield Theres probably a way to do it but I couldnt figure out how to keep the Home and Back buttons on so I could see the light as I aligned the shield And so I did have to lift it back up once to correctly fit Zagg should have instructions to do the followingAfter cleaning and prepping to install the shield hold the bottom edge against the phone and align the Home and Back buttons then slowly lower the glass over the speaker and camera at the topAll said and done I really like the end results This screen protector blends in perfectly with the TECH21 EVO case SmokieBlack The finished look merits 5 stars but perfection is required for the install to phone and not everyone has dexterity 100 For that Id give it 3 stars However Zagg was friendly and compliant about the replacement so Im averaging that out to 4StarsGood Luck ,positive
I made the big mistake of not reading the reviews for this before I bought it Ive purchased Zagg products before and have always been happyespecially with their screen protectors I never purchased the glass protector before but figured I would this time around since I now have to worry about my phone with a new child Since Zagg has always been so great I didnt bother reading the reviews Boy was that a mistake Had a read the reviews ahead of time I would have not purchased the glass protector I purchased the S7 not the S7 edge but what some people dont realize people who are claiming that the review writers bought the S7 protector for the S7 edge is that there is a slight curve to the screen on the edges Its very subtle but it is there and I didnt even realize it until I put the glass protector on and it didnt sit flat at the edges I kept trying to push it down thinking I just didnt apply enough pressure at the edges but if you squeeze down harder on the edges itself then a bubble starts to form towards the middle As its the glass it cant bend to fit securely on the screen so once I put pressure on the edge it was forces to keep its form and come up in other places to achieve that state My photos show where the protector didnt seal against the screen along the edgewhere its sealed its black and where its gray is where its not sealed I am very disappointed with Zagg on this product because had they actually tested this on a unit they would have realized it wouldnt work and not sell it Seems like the just got the measurements of the phone and just created the screen protector for it Im going to return this to Best Buy and purchased the HD screen protectorof course after reading the reviews I see that Zagg is going to come out with a curved glass protector for both the new S7 phones but until then I will need something to protect the screen ,positive
The Zagg glass covering my regular Samsung S7 is terrific with one major drawback It seems that even my regular S7 has a slight curve in the screen on the long edges Therefore the last 18 or so of the sides of the Zagg glass cover are not really touching the screen If you dont have a case or if your case doesnt have tall enough sides to protect the screen you will find yourself touching those areas and inevitably making fingeredgeshaped breaks in the glass This can not be helped the glass is hanging there off the screen These breaks only extend as far as the raised part of the cover where it does not touch the screen but REALLY NOW This is not what I paid a premium price for I would have thought this issue would have played into the design of the cover I fear that ZAGG will be replacing this cover more than once over the phones lifetime ,negative
Not the best fit around the edges as others have stated The S7 non edge version does have a slight bend around the edge of the glass So the zaag glass screen protector does not fit well on the outside edge It looks like you didnt press the screen protector down or have an air bubble on the Edge but you dont The screen protector is constantly lifted just a little off the screen With a case on you dont notice it as much but if you try to drag icons to the Edge or use the edge of your phone it doesnt work until you press VERY hard I purchased the non edge screen protector for the Non edge s7 and it just doesnt live up to the zaaz quality you expect I gave it 1 star as it does protect the screen from damage but makes it hard to use The 2nd star is because of the added bonus of collecting all the lint in my pocket 2 photos are of the issue pen is not lifting the screen protector just showing where the Edge is and the lifted edge Case on the phone is the Spigen® Ultra Hybrid AIR CUSHION Crystal Clear ,positive
Even after being assured by Best Buy rep who was great BTW did look at these reviews with me that this thing would fit it doesnt Not even a week later dustdirt under both sides Contacted Zagg who is now putting one out that DOES cover the edges Zaggs reply was that this is SUPPOSED to fit like this That this protector is supposed to have a halo effect on around the edges and that all of their products have a lift Huh So then why not advertise this as such due to the S7 design inform your biggest retailer that the sides will NOT lay flat 700 phone I dont want some misfit piece of junk covering the screen And unfortunately this is all Best Buy has to offer if you want to leave the store with a protector on Zagg is indeed putting out a new one that promises to cover the sides of both S7 and S7 Edge I guess thats a coincidence And they are NOT going to exchange these defects that they claim are not defective They are offering an exchange for the exact same product So by that offer and their joke offer of free shipping we should be exchanging these weekly then Major fail on Zagg Major fail for not letting Best Buy reps know this product is supposed to not lay flat And major fail for not being willing to exchange them Stay far away from this mess Unless you want to be 48 out 3999 plus installation You work too hard for your money dont throw it away ,negative
I have always used recommended and even sold Zagg screen protectors as a wireless professional but I must admit these S7 Invisible Shield Glass suck Thinking it was an issue with the installation or possibly a defective product I emailed Zagg they sent me a replacement waived shipping costs and didnt require that I sent them the original shield back Well after a week and a half I got the new one after I powered it off and let it sit for 510 mins I obsessively cleaned my brand new S7 installed the new shield and let it sit overnight The next morning I awoke to find the same halo or ring around my screen where the adhesive didnt stick I emailed Zagg 3 times more asking if I paid the difference and upgraded to the Curved Glass Shield would it remedy my issue 10 days later and well outside my orig 30 im still awaiting an answer Is this really what they provide a customer for 4499 I put my otterbox on it and left it on untill I find a company who makes something suitable You made me sad Zagg Not cool all ,negative
I have used Zagg screen protectors for all my devices and if I need to replace my crack screen protector not a problem when I can just pay 5 for a replacement I believe that this is best screen protector on the market today The great thing about this protector and not just this protector from Zagg but all their screen protectors have a lifetime warranty After your purchase the screen protector the first thing you do is go to the Zagg website and register the screen protector because If your screen protector has happens to crack instead of having to buy a new one just login into the Zagg website and order a replacement screen for only 5 which covers shipping or shipping is free I dont remember They will send you a screen protector once you received in the mail go to best buy have them remove the old screen protector and put on the new screen protector Then you send old screen protector back to Zagg using the yellow envelope that they sent you in the mail Though you spend a lot of money for the best screen protector on the market and if it cracks order a replacement for 5 and send in the old one without having to buy a new one each time I recommend getting the Glass screen protector NOT the Plastic version I will say for the S7 screen protectors that there a some batches of the product out there that have not worked out the issue with fully protecting the screen with the short curve it has I still does the job because I have a case on my S7 you hardly notice it ,positive
Let me say that I love Samsung and the Galaxy phones as well as Zagg in the past I have had nothing but great experiences with both products and companies However the new phones specifically the Galaxy S7 has a beveled edge to the screen This means that the screen protector will NOT lay flat all the way to the edge The original salesperson gave me the line that the screen protector would blend to the edges over time It has been months and the edges are still off the glass And let me be clear the staff at Best Buy installed this product I have kept the screen protector on but this means that dirt gathers under the lip and it suffers from small frays and cracks I have no idea what Zagg would say if the glass broke probably something about it being my fault since the screen protector was frayed But it still provides protection for the phone I am just hoping that with all of the engineering minds at both companies they will come out with a screen protector that lays flat But as I am writing this the salesperson I recently spoke with says that it doesnt exist ,negative
I had Zagg glass piece on my S5 and then I threw my phone out of anger and it shattered the Zagg glass but kept my S5 screen intact I called Zagg n they sent me a replacement glass for my S5 So when I bought the S7 I decided to pay the 8 for the Best Buy employee to put it on The girl ruined the first one then the second attempt had a crack in it so it wouldnt seal right and the third time a piece of lint was trapped The fourth time was the charm or so I thought The edges look like they are still not sealed kind of looks like small bubbles and i keep trying to press it down and they disappear and come right back Its been over a month and I just havent had time to go back to Best Buy Its noticeable but not enough for me to go up there Well last week i was pushing on the edges as i often do and now its got a small crack that looks like how a window looks when a bullet goes through it There is also a chip on the edge that curves around the home button Now Im not happy especially since this was a 40 piece of glass Ive never had issues with Zagg glass until this one for my S7 It just seems like the quality isnt as good I hope they can replace it at store when I go this week Im going to give this one more try because Ive always considered these Zagg glass pieces to be a good investment to protect my phones expensive screen ,positive
I had a different brand screen protector from verizon store for 2 years on my HTC One M8 and it worked great I upgrade to the S7 and got the zagg screen prootector and it doesnt respond to my touch on one side of the screen unless i press down harder than normal Also if i run my finger along the side it wont start to recognize my touch until about a third of the way up the screen I tried returning it to Best Buy within 15 days and they refused to return or exchange it and instead directed me to the manufacturers website 3 weeks after purchase the screen chipped on the side and started to crack even though i never even dropped the phone or treated it roughly Apparently now i have to spend additonal funds for shipping to replace this fine product when it is a lifetime warranty Puts a bad taste in the mouth because of Best Buys return policy or should i say lack there of To top it off there is nothing on the receipt that explains their return policy Better yet the cell phone rep installs it immediately on the phone when its purchased which immediately cancels any chance of returning if you changed your mind ,negative
When I originally bought this product it was 40 Immediately after putting it on the screen protector did not adhere to my phone on the outside edges at all I have a regular Samsung Galaxy s7 not s7 edge and I made sure to buy the right screen protector But when I put it on my phone there is at least a centimeter or two on the entire outside edge that is lifted up and will not stick to the phone My friend had the same problem and even after ordering a replacement the replacement had the same exact issue as well Before ordering the replacement I had the original for two months and let me tell you there were cracks EVERYWHERE It would crack at the lightest drop bump scratch anything Honestly it cracked much easier than the phone itself ever would and while that should be a good thing it was just annoying Because the entire outer edge is lifted its super easy so get water or dust particles stuck underneath the screen protector Overall this purchase was a mistake Just stay with regular screen protectorsnot the glass ones Theyll save you a lot of money and frustration ,negative
Bought this screen protector for my Galaxy S7 and was not impressed with how it looked on my phone It did fit onto my screen but all around the edge of it it looks like it is lifted and has bubbles I got it put on at Best Buy and the employee who did it told me they all look that way due to the curves around the entire phone It drives me a little crazy but now I just ignore it I needed it more for protection for my screen I can say that it does have a year guarantee with Zagg if you register it and if something happens to it you pay a small replacement fee and theyll send you a new one Unfortunately I cracked this screen protector within a few days because I accidentally dropped it onto a cement floor It did save my actual screen though Thats what happens when you carry to many things at once Cracked the screen protector the first time it fell and still havent replaced it yet I am going to once I stop procrastinating Personally I dont think its worth the 40 because I was unhappy with the way it looked on my phone and unhappy that it broke the first time it fell It did save my actual screen so I still gave it 3 stars ,negative
I wanted to clear up the complaints about the edge of the screen protector having a haze or not making complete contact It is true however there is more to the story First the reason this is occurring is the new S7 design has a rounded corner along the edge not the S7 Edge the regular S7 This softens the edge Zagg failed to take this into account when they release the screen protector One option would have been to slightly shrink the size to match the flat surface and not extend over the curved portion of the screen That is the reason you have poor or no contact around the edge Is this important With your screen off black you can see it When the screen is on you can not see it Also if you have something like an Otter skin or Tech21 protector on your phone it hides it even more It is aggravating Zagg did not account for this but the safety and protection delivered by this glass screen protector is superior to anything else I have seen I had one on my S6 for the last year and it looks like the day I bought it Dont let the complaints about the edge discourage you Maybe Zagg will react quickly and release and updated version that addresses this ,negative
Someone at the store recommended this screen protector after it was installed I noticed it doesnt actually fit on the screen The Galaxy S7 not the edge still has a slight curvature on the sides That curvature means the glass doesnt fit flush and dust and dirt can and will get stuck under the screen You also end up looking at a piece of glass that is clearly not attached to the screen The gap between screen and glass around the edges also makes it hard to press buttons around the edge I would not recommend this unless they fix the gapping issue As it stands Im curious when the dust and dirt build up under the edges is going to drive me crazy and force me to go with a different protector In the attached picture you can see the gap around the edges ,negative
There are those people who needed a screen protector because they will drop their phone guaranteed I however am not one of those people I havent used Screen protector in years because other than usual wear and tear my screens typically look pretty dang good by the time I get a new phone For some reason they convinced me this time I got the case They installed it Looked perfect I was pretty pleaseduntil 6 days later it chipped and was dropping teeny tiny pieces of glass everywhere Then less than 24 hours later a large chunk of the corner chipped and made a crack So I took it back and they replaced it for free bc of the short time They gave me specific instructions for care the first 48 hours which they failed to include the first so I figured this time would be different I followed the instructions really well It was a weekend so I barely even touched my phone And here I am 6 days later 2 of those days the phone was unused and I have a chip a decent sized chip When I pay 40 for a screen protector it is expected to last Extremely disappointed in the product will never use it again ,positive
I bought two phones at Best Buy and had the protecters installed on both phones My phone is ok But my wifes is lifting around the edges Same phones same protectors She went back to Best Buy to see if they could fix the problem Their response was go to Zagg website and register it or Ill sell you a new one that fits the S7 properly Or Zagg will send you a new one for a cost of 500 They wouldnt make good on it because she went back after 14 days We purchased the items May 14th 2016 She went in on June 27 th because we had been out of town We were not aware of the Zagg warranty because they Best Buy employees threw away the screenprotector and phone case packaging away After they put the protector and case on The principal of the matter is if they put the wrong protector on whey should we have to pay the 5 dollars for the replacement or pay for a new one I feel it is their response ability to put the right products on your devices in the first place Still havent registered it yet Because of the principal behind the matter I have had this brand of protector on past phones with no issues what so ever I ,negative
I gave 5 stars because the product itself is great in my opinion I love zagg glass screen protectors but this one is not the right fit for the Galaxy S7 due to the slight curve on the sides of the phone The shield stays uplifted on the sides which caused the shield to crack on the bottom right edge of the screen protector being that it does not lay flat on the phone screen It was installed at Best Buy at the time of purchase I will definitely continue to buy zagg glass screen protectors again for my other products but not for this phone unless the protector is slightly curved like the phone I would recommend this product but not for this phone ,positive
Having recent moved from a Blackberry Z10 to the Samsung S7 I needed some sort of screen protector for the S7 From talking with others it was a toss up between the Zagg Glass or HD screen protector I went with the glass screen protector as the conversion always seemed to come back to it is better to break the glass on the screen protector than the actual screen Well as the S7 does not have a protected edge and I initially was using my S7 without a case and storing the S7 in my belt clip holster after a few slides across my car seats and down between the car seat rail and the floor the edges of the glass screen protector did exactly what they were suppose to do they chipped on the egdes Of course in an area where your fingers are normally when you are holding the phone For now I have added an OtterBox Commuter case to the phone and nave stopped using my holster This keeps my fingers from picking up little glass fragments however it means that my phone is in my back pocket on my desk or sitting on the table I will be replacing the glass InvisibleShield with an HD InvisibleShield soon ,negative
Zagg should have been prepared to deal with the S7s screen edges I am pretty disappointed in how the left and right edges of the screen protector are not in contact with the screen This causes the p and other far left or right items to be a pain to register In writing this is had to tap multiple times on the p to get it to register It requires more of a press than a tap Ive heard rumors that Zagg is fixing this issue in the next few months The raised edges have also presented a weak point in the strength of the screen protector The top and bottom corners in one side began to crack even though I have my phone in an otterbox slimIn the end however I would still recommend as currently there is not much better of an option and Zagg is supposed to fix it soon Im expecting an unconditional swap once the new ones are available Note to Zagg you should pay for the Geek Squad installation as Ive already paid and continue to deal with issues from your product ,positive
This is one of the worst products Ive ever purchased I had TMobile put it on since best buy charges a fee to apply it lame The guy who put it on said he didnt care for these particular ones and when I asked why his reply was oh you will find out soon enough well low n behold I did The edges of the screen protector wouldnt completely adhere to the phone screen It was like a bubble or something all the way around on the edges of it and within approximately 68 hours later there was already a couple cracks on the edges By the next day there was quite a few more I have only had it on my phone for a week and it looks like its been on for 6 months Needless to say it was a waste of 40 Doesnt really matter to me that its a lifetime warranty cause its pointless since I would have to send it in for a new one every other day I would give it 0 stars if I could ,negative
If you can get it on the phone right and I mean if this is an excellent screen protector The nicest thing about it is it is actually made of glass so you preserve the feel of the face of the phone and its very friendly to the touch The downside is you have to be extremely careful putting it on you pretty much have one chance If you get a single Speck of dust under this thing or if it goes on slightly crooked or anything like that youre going to have a bubble and its going to drive you insane until you buy the next one They do have a warranty and they better for 50 bucks You have to send it in to get the exchange though I much prefer the store brand if its available I bought this one that particular day because they were out of stock The store brand screen protector which I believe is by Insignia it has plenty of cleaning materials and also it has a plastic guide to Aid in installation Ive done two of them on my other phone and they work perfectly every time and theyre half the price ,positive
I wanted a tempered glass shield for my tobeshipped S7 this was the only S7 screen shield my local store hadWhen my S7 arrived I applied this shield My S7 was brand spanking new But the bottom part of this shield didnt stickI was passing by a Best Buy Mobile store figured they would have more choices wrong and stopped in they were closing early what the heck and the people there said they wouldnt exchange the shield because it had been more than 15 days I think they just wanted to go home Gee whiz I couldnt apply the shield until the new S7 arrived in the mailSo I made a special trip back to the same Best Buy where I bought the shield and exchanged it for a new one Ill try reapplying it soon Hope it worksI did not have this much trouble with a generic tempered glass shield I bought from e bay for my S5Very disappointed that all the Best Buy stores dont treat customers the same way ,negative
I dont know why people hate this so much Its probably because they didnt have the Best Buy guy put this on for them If its done properly this stuff is great Ive put this on several of my phones and have it for my parents phones and its good stuff In case you are clumsy and drop your phone at least this will crack first not your glass on your phone You can spend 35 on this stuff or pay 100 to replace the glass on your phone and hope it works the same It will make your phone a bit heavier too but it will keep your phone safe especially if you have kids who break their phones all the time Plus it helps keep your phone cleaner too its easy to clean and keeps your phone germ free Have the Best Buy people put this on for you they are the experts and will make sure its done right Dont do it yourself thats why you guys all hate it and think it sucks And you got ta let it chill for a day or two you cant picking at it or messing with it right away ,positive
The issue of this screen protector not fitting the Galaxy S7 has been well documented in reviews so I will not reiterate the issue Zagg messed up on this one and should have recalled this product long ago especially for the price Zaggs website no longer list this product for the S7 as they now have a curved Glass protector for the S7 and S7 Edge I called Zagg and they will replace this screen protector for the new curved one but there is currently one issue with the new one The new curved Glass protector only comes in opaque black The screen is obviously clear but the portion that covers the color portion of the face is opaque so your gold platinum or other color phone is covered and will have a black face FYI BB does not carry the new curved Zagg product To be fair the old product will work and protect your screen if you do not mind the halo effect Zagg should lower the price of this product considerably to compensate ,positive
This screen protector isnt perfect but it really isnt the fault of the protector Samsungs decision to slightly curve the sides of the S7s screen makes finding a good glass screen protector difficult Ive owned 2 protectors that seal to the screen fully BUT they didnt cover the whole viewing screen and left annoying edges on the on the touch screen The Zagg protector covers the entire viewing screen but does not seal to it completely because of the curves The edges of the screen are responsive more protected and I dont notice the edges not being fully sealed It also fits well with a Speck case or an Otter DefenderZagg does now make a curved protector but it is considerably more expensive and some reviewers say it is tough to put a case on with the curved protector installed As long as I own an S7 this Zagg is my choice ,positive
I purchased this glass screen protector knowing full well what the reviews were on it But I felt I did not have a choice as you never know what will happen to your phone Overall it does the job but there are 2 significant issues you should be aware of that are frustrating at times but in my opinion should not prevent you from buying the product Issue 1 is that you WILL get a halo effect around the edge of the display as the Galaxy S7s screen is slightly curved Along with this halo effect the screen protector can get a little dirty around the edge but it has been very minor for me The second issue and maybe the bigger problem of the 2 is that the touch screen sensitivity is made less in certain areas which can drive you crazy at times Sliding down notifications from the top or pressing any button around the edge typically requires y a harder press This being said it is probably still the best option for protecting your S7 ,negative
This screen protector has a great feel and does an awesome job at resisting oilsmudges The only problem is that it does not fit the slightly beveled edge of the Galaxy S7 nonEdge The result is a halo effect a quick online search will show this is a universal problem due to a design flaw around the edge of the phone which attracts dirt and lint under it almost immediately I would recommend finding a more temporary perhaps nonglass version until Zagg updates their design to accommodate the edges of this phoneAnd remember Best Buy at least in Woodbridge VA will charge you about 8 to install one of these screen protectors even if you purchase the brand new phone from them complain about the fitment of the protector before you leave and get told to just bring it back and well replace it if the fit doesnt resolve itself after a couple days ,negative
I purchased the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and like all my other smart phones i have had i want screen protection I purchased the Zagg Glass Screen Protector because of Zaggs quality and reputation I had Best Buy install this on my phone cause i am not to good at this sort of thing He warned me that with this Glass Screen Protector there was going to be a Halo around the edge of the screen cause the Samsung Galaxy S7 screen is curved at the edge I thought this was ok What i did not anticipate was under the glass where the halo is its a dust magnet Pocket lint and dust gets under the glass and looks bad I am unsure what to do about it cause i still want screen protection but the dust under the halo is so annoying I hope zagg comes out with a new and improved product cause i will probably just take this off soon and go with out Also this screen protector is EXPENSIVE not worth the price when it has a halo that collects dirt ,negative
My husband and I both purchased these for our new Samsung S7 phones not edge Mine cracked in the corner just being in my purse I believe something got underneath the edge that doesnt stick to the screen and caused the crack My husband dropped his phone and all around the edges was cracked We ordered warranty replacements and Zagg only sent us plastic protectors not the glass When I asked about this obvious problem with the glass the rep said they are aware of the problem and are waiting for a new design to become available Were still waiting In the meantime Zagg is harassing me to send back my broken glass screen protector or they are going to charge me full retail for the replacements they sent us I dont have a lot of trust in this companys design or warranty process These certainly were no where near worth the money spent or all the hype ,negative
Center of screen area is great and seems to proctect well from scratches etc however with the slightly contoured edges of the s7 the flat screen protector leaves a ring around the outside of the phone screen where it is not actually attached to the screen this gap allows for dust and the like to get under the screen protector edges which I find frustrating as I try to keep my phone screen clean I have had it on my phone for about two weeks I am gentle with my phone in daily use and there are already two cracks in the screen protector only at the edges where the screen protector does not actually seal to the phone while its understandable that free floating glass would be fragile it is still annoying to see every day on my phone and I think if the screen protector actually sealed to the screen all the way around this probably would not have happened ,positive
I purchased this screen protector for my Galaxy S7 because I was very happy with the one I had on my Galaxy Note 4I love the fact that the glass shield actually feels like the phone itself and yet offers excellent protection at the same timeIve only been using this protector for 3 months luckily no drops to test its capabilities but I have no doubts that this will work as well as the one I had for the Note 4Zagg is very easy to work with both registering the product and getting a replacement when neededOf special note to me anyways I had to replace my phone within a week of purchasing it and putting on the Zagg Shield and I was able to remove the shield and reapply it to the new phone without a hitchThis is easily the best investment for protecting my phone that I could have ,positive
Ive owned other Zagg Glass screen protectors that have worked out very well but this one seems to be lesser quality The shield doesnt cover the phone all the way to its edges The edges dont adhere because of the slightly curved phone edges Within two days of application the screen protector was already cracked in the corner Ordered a warranty replacement and within a few days of application of that one there was a big scratch across the face of it I keep the phone in my purse and have never had issues with other Zagg products Ive had this phone for about a month and already had two screen protectors replaced Ordering warranty replacements add up when you have to keep paying for shipping ,negative
Have use Zagg products in the past for different phonesThe S7 NON EDGE Model still has a very slight curve on the sides of the displayThe glass protector is flat and therefore leaves the smallest of gaps around the edges of the phoneThis gap will cause the protective layer to crack as I experienced when I dropped the phone and the glass protector cracked at the bottom right exactly where the gap between the protection layer and screen exist Supposedly Zagg recognizes this gap and is updating the product to fit flush in future product releasesIve removed the cracked screen protector completely and have gone with the Lifeproof FRE case Save yourself 40 and find a solid case or a correctly formed screen protector ,positive
Purchased this because I was told it was the best screen protector Paid the tech at the store to put it on and within 4 days it lifted from the corner Was told I had to contact Zagg to get a replacement and will then have to pay again to have it placed on the phone My hand shakes so its not best for me to do it Inconvenient for sure I have to answer whether or not I would recommend this and can only pick yes or no My answer is truthfully I dont know that option is not available And I havent dropped the phone thankfully If I do before the replacement arrives and my screen cracks I will be extremely unhappy ,positive
Weve used Zagg shields in the past and loved them Had them on our wife and I S5s and they saved us once each And easy replacement from Zagg customer service is without reproach This particular shield isnt perfect though Right at the edge of the screen it doesnt stay stuck down The S7 has a slight fall off near the edge that isnt flat You can see the shield doesnt make contact around that border and requires a little harder tap if theres something right near the edge of the screen Its about 18 on either sideI still think this is probably the best product on the market for the phone The soft shields are horrible Even the Zagg soft one comes too close to the edges it was an exact perfect fit and precludes the use of a cover that comes up over the edge ,positive
This is just a patch that ZAGG released early as a way to get people to buy a screen protector they know doesnt fit ZAGG support says a contoured one will release beginning of April so wait until then to get one Best Buy should put out a notice in the meantime that you are purchasing a faulty product Should just buy a case with a screen shield until then unless you dont mind dust collectors and scratching yourself on the screen protector ,negative
Zagg just announced that the curved version of this protector is now available I recommend purchasing that protector insteadYes even the nonEdge version of the S7 has a slight curve at the L R edges And since this protector is flat it separates from the screen at the edges The Best Buy associate used the euphemism of it being a halo effect but did not tell me about this feature until after I purchased it and had them install it If it were only cosmetic it would not bother me that much However realize that where the protector does not touch the screen the touch screen will obviously be inoperative So things like dragging icons from one home screen to the next is difficult unless you press down hard when doing so ,negative
My wife and I recently bought Galaxy S7 phones We bought the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector at the same time and had them installed in the store Zagg produced an original glass screen protector which was flat Subsequently after the release of the S7 phone Zagg produced a protector that has curved edges to match the screen of the S7 When using the flat screen protector on an S7 the edges of the protector tend to chip and split because the edges of the protector do not curve with the screen Buying the protector at the time of purchasing the phone the sales associate put on a flat protector Why The problem with the flat screen is a know problem I will eventually have to have the screen protector replaced with one that s curved I just dont get why they installed the problem protector ,negative
Best Buy had only one brand in stock for my my Samsung Galaxy s7 phone It smudges leaves your fingerprints hard to clean its not clear looks dirty when its actually clean It doesnt stick properly there are alot of air bubbles I personally think is not worth it especially for the price I would not buy this productbrand again nor would I recommend it The one I had prior worked better was cheaper and didnt smudge and was very clear Also there were no air bubbles It lasted a long time I am going to return it Supposedly this brand has a long warranty which I have to double check Its kinda hard to know whether or not its going to work because its a one shot try and deal ,positive
Ive used these products before from this company but find them to be a little bit expensive it doesnt quite cover the screen appropriate age of the bend in the glass on a Galaxy S7 I found that to be the first place that it cracked when I dropped it I need to send it back to the company to see if they truly will replace it heard that they will and I also heard that they have a new product that will cover the screen little bit better will be about 5 more Im hoping they will replace it with just a newer version however I found other brands and different stores that cost a little bit less actually about half the price sticker glass and covers the screen better not sure if the warranty on the glass to be a forever warranty is worth the price or not yet I would still recommend this product to a friend ,positive
We purchased another Zagg Glass after the original one was not meant for our Galaxy 7 We inadvertently purchased the Glass for the Galaxy 7 Edge This new Glass was sent to us by Zagg and it still really doesnt fit the screen well We followed the installation instructions exactly and the Glass is coming away from the screen at the long side of the phone Both my husband and I have the Galaxy 7 and this is happening to both our phones My husbands Glass has already cracked at one of the sides that isnt adhering Neither the crack nor the sides not sticking to the screen is affecting the overall performance of the phone so we will probably just keep these Our prior phone was a Galaxy 5 with Zagg Glass and we had no issues whatsoever ,negative
I grant you that my review on this item is more a reflection of bad design on Samsungs end rather than a poorly made product on Zaggs side The slightly rounded edge around the outside of the screen makes any kind of screen protector not want to stick very well and this poor adhesion in my experience with four or five of both the HD glass series and the regular HD Zagg Shields creates air pockets where the screen protectors just peel up over time and then pop off completely when you try to stick your phone in your pocket Theyre a pain Dont get me wrong I absolutely love Zagg products They are excellent But on these phones both the S7 and the S7 edgenote they are functionally poor Its better just to buy a cheap doublesided phone protector elsewhere ,negative
installation of the screen protector was easy and worked perfectly until it got to the last 18 of the outside edge of the phone No matter how hard I pressed the adhesive would not stick down I even put books and weights on top of it but it still didnt work Now the edges are open for dust and dirt to get underneath the screen protector and completely ruins the purpose of having one Now I not only have to figure out a way to remove the screen protector I also have to purchase a new oneBecause it has a lifetime guarantee I can get a new one for free just pay additional shipping and handling but Im worried it will do the exact same thing I will not purchase this brand of screen protector in the future ,positive
I bought this 2 days ago and i was so excited being that it seemed to be a great product Not today i noticed that the sides didnt lay down flush with the phone screen because the screen has a slight curve to the edgesi own the regular S7 not the edge Now because the side werent flush with the phone the screen protector shattered Ether i am going to have to see if best buy will replace with out the box or wait for zagg to do it and pay at lease 4 more and be right back where i started with a bad design screen protector Total waste of 40 never buying Zag again should have stayed with Ghost Armor ,positive
I usually get the high grade self healing film for my phone It was not in stock at the store and so this screen protector was recommended by the sales person They put it on my phone before I left and told me the halo around the edge would disappear It was still there a week later I received my case a week later and put the case on The corner caught on the case and shattered NOT GOODI did call the store to complain and was directed to come in for a different screen protector as I did NOT want the same item replacement from the manufacturer When the new screen protector arrived the store did apply it for me and now Im very happy with my new film screen protector I will not get the glass type screen protector ever again ,positive
I purchased my tempered glass screen protector about two months ago When I went home and applied the screen protector to my phone I was disappointed with the finished product because the edges of the tempered glass would not adhere to the edges of my screen So I took my phone with the tempered glass back to Best Buy That is when I found out that a Best Buy professional would have applied the screen protector for me to ensure that it was applied correctly This is when they also informed me that it would take some time for the edges of the screen protector to adhere to the screen Two months later and the edges of the screen protector still have not adhered to my phone screen and now the tempered glass has also cracked ,negative
This is the first ZAgg tempered glass protector I have bought and I didnt read the reivews first or I would have passed The s7 screen slightly rolls back on the sides so the tempered glass doesnt lay against the sides it just floats above the screen This may be why folks are breaking the things when pulling or retrieving from purses or pockets The edges snag and crack or chip the tempered glass I use a tech21 glass that fits snug around the edges so the edges arent out there to snag on stuff so mine hsnt been a problem The screen saver doesnt effect the high quality of the screen image like the ones I have used in the past so thats a plus Even if they make these things curved how would you get it to line up I cant recommend it though until they update the curve issue ,negative
I went into the Best Buy Mobile store that is located in the mall since the main store would not put this on my phone and allowed the manager there to do it He messed up on it when he put it on and Im glad he did I see what everyone is complaining about On the screen not the part around the screen that is the color of the phone about a millimeter from the edge the glass cover is not mesh with the screen I played with my phone a little bit to see if it would bother me and it did so the manager removed it and had to write it off I hope they redo this screen I have seen them on other phones and tablets as well and they are mesh with the entire face of the phone and look nice I would recommend it if they make it fit correctly like it does on the iphone and tablets ,positive
I purchased this product after such great experience in the past with zagg glass shield I knew at the time of purchase that it doesnt quite fit exact After reading several reviewsIt is noted on the Galaxy S7 the screen has just a slight curve on the edge This is not the S7 edge just the base S7 model However the Glass Shield does not have the small curve to it This leaves a slight halo effect on the sides of the screen The sales person at best buy kept saying this will go away after a few days This has not changed However I did not expect it to change After reading information on the Zagg website I found they are reworking the product and will be putting out a different model in the future that does curve slightly on the edge ,positive
I replaced my Edge with regular S7 and assumed that the glass protector would fit well if I had a flat screen however the regular S7s screen is not completely flat either although it is obviously moreso than the Edge and so the glass protector does not seal fully on both the right and left sides Ive had the protector on for about a week and already have MULTIPLE cracks and breaks in the screen protector I will not bother having it replaced as it does not fit well in the first place I looked online after it was clearly too late at this point to see if there was a trick to fix it and found that lots of people had similar problems with no solution Save your time and money and avoid the glass protector ,negative
The Zagg screen saver feels just like the unprotected screen on my Samsung S7 Note I have it on the S7 not the edge The screen saver went on easily but I think the edges of the S7 not edge are slightly curved down and the screen saver does not make full contact with the edges About 18 of an inch on both sides are light gray I can press the screen saver down on the edges but it pulls right back up It has not caused any functional problems using the phone just looks odd ,positive
My fiancé and I both preordered the S7 I got the Edge When we picked them up he got a case screen protector We didnt want to pay 5 for an associate to apply it so we took care of that at home I can not believe how ill fitted it is The edge on both sides does not fit due to the curve of the phone so the entire screen is not protected His screen protector cracked on the edge within 3 days of purchase after he dropped it in the bathroom Im so happy to see that Zagg is redesigning them to fit the S7 but I know we wont be able to swap the ill fitted one for it What a waste of 40 It shouldnt have ever been released if it didnt fit properly Wait for the remake DO NOT BUY THIS ONE ,negative
I bought this while I was in the store when a woman came in wanting a new phone because her screen was literally Destroyed It looked like it was shot with a bullet The geek squad tech took a look at it and realized she had a ZAGG Screen Protector He removed it and her phone was in PERFECT CONDITION She was Amazed the tech was amazed he even said her phone should be the poster child for the ZAGG Protector I was Amazed and Bought one on the Spot And she did not have replacement insurance She was So Happy and Satisfied ,positive
Definite addon We put this on my wifes phone since she doesnt have the best track record with phones and we are very glad we did Two weeks after putting it on her phone she was buckling herself into the car and she hit the screen of her phone glancingly with the buckle There was a spiderweb crack that appeared on the screen where she hit it Upon further inspection it turns out that the screen protector did its job and absorbed all the damage We filed a claim with Zagg and got the new screen protector in about 4 days We took the new screen protector and phone down to our local BB and they happily installed the new one free of chargeWell worth the investment ,positive
The Best Buy sales associate recommended that I purchase this Zagg screen protector for my new S7 phone You cant even tell you have it on the phone I was able to tap and use all of the selections on my phone easily Very smooth and clear Within 3 weeks of having my new phone and this screen protector I noticed a deep chip on the screen protector and was fearful that it went all the way down through to my phones screen But this Zagg protector did exactly what it was supposed to do It took the hit and saved my phone screen Then Zagg replaced the chipped protector like they guarantee All in all Best Buy and Zagg and this product were great ,positive
I was very disappointed with the screen protector I had Geek Squad put it on they had told me after then put it on to wait 24 to 48 hours to put the phone back into a case I proceeded have waited at least a week tried to put the phone in the case and started filling up the edges and make bubbles screen protector I do not recommend anybody getting this type of screen protector if youre going to be putting it into a case I just wasted 35 bucks for a screen protector that absolutely did nothing and I will not recommend this to anyone Im sorry to be the bearer of bad news but I think thats why I shouldnt make this right with me give me some line of credit but I will not buy a screen protector from them again ,negative
This was a very pricey screen protector and I expected it to last with my minimal phone usage and protective care It cracked within a month This protector when applied to the galaxy 7 leaves a significant gap between the edge of the screen protector and the phone case This is where my crack originated having hit something lightly just on the edge of the screen protector This product does come with a lifetime warranty I believe and they will replace the protector which requires the cracked one be sent to them As the crack does not yet bother me to use my phone I have not yet attempted to submit a claim Hopefully I am not replacing this screen protector regularly only time will tell ,negative
I bought this one to replace the one I purchased a year and a half ago Its glass so it will crack but it totally protects your screen If you get a chip in it you will feel it when you rub your finger across it but you dont feel the cracks Easy to install and bubbles are easily removed The only thing I dont like about it is it doesnt seem to adhere on the edges Theres a small ring less than a quarter inch wide around the outside of the protector that I cant seem to get to stick to the phone Maybe this is by design so you can easily remove it ,negative
I purchased two of these screen protectors one for an S7 black and another for an S7 gold Surprisingly the screen protector did not fully adhere to the black S7 and had a visible halo on the edges where the protector could not stick due to a very slight curve of the screen edges The gold S7 did not have this problem and the protector worked fine sticking completely without the halo If you run into this issue Zagg upgraded me to the Glass curve protector through their warranty program which worked on the black S7 Not sure why they havent fully addressed this Never had a problem with a Zagg product before Just be aware of your model before buying ,positive
I had the salesperson install this when setting up the S7 and it wasnt his 1st installation but even though this is not the S7 edge the cover never laid down to the edges It left a 18 inch wide gray line all the way around the screen Great for catching pocket lint I thought You could press it down but it would come back up instantly The case was not on it so it wasnt the case I gave up until the next morning and tried again and it started chipping and cracking on the edges this will be my 1st and last glass cover Going to back to get the non glass HD like I had on my S5 and hope that works and hope to get my money back on this one ,positive
I had to get this replaced a few months after purchase due to it breakingtearingcracking It cut my finger when I tried to use my phone Best buy replaced it and reinstalled the new one It worked good again for a few months then started to lift in the upper corner then cracked on one side then cracked again below the first crack The cracks are small enough and close enough to the edge they havent cut my finger yet I will have to replace soon though Im sure I had a better one on my last phone but cant remember what the name of it was ,positive
My husband is on his third Zagg screen protector He keeps dropping his phone and he is very glad he purchased this particular screen protector We like Zagg because unlike others you are not required to return the item to receive the replacement The first time his protector broke they had one in stock at our Best Buy store and he was able to replace it on the spot The second time the store was out of stock so they ordered one which came within two business days of ordering Very good customer service ,positive
We have always used Zagg protectors First I tried the Zagg curved glass protector Not sure if we had a defective one but the protector didnt seem to adhere to the screen except around the very edge After a week I put a Otterbox Symmetry case on the phone and Zagg curve glass protector popped off When touching the center of the protector there was no adhesive to the touch except around the edges Then I got the standard non curved Zagg It works better with the Otterbox Symmetry case The one negative for this product is the glass on the S7 has a slight curve The Zagg doesnt contour to this curve So you get a halo around the protector which dustdirt gets under ,negative
This screen cover is a joke especially at 40 heck I wouldnt recommend it if it was 1 I decided to splurge on it in store wof looking up reviews because I thought zagg was supposed to make the best tempered glass protectors As others have mentioned the sides do not adhere at all due to mild curves of the screen I was meticulous putting this on my 1 day old phone and I can guarantee it wasnt my fault Luckily best buy gave me a refund but these are a total scam and seriously need to be taken off the shelves ,positive
So i was told about this by one of the Bestbuy phone people and after hearing him put about how great it was i gave it a try the first problem i have with it was fit the edges of the protector dont fit flush with my phone and are a little lifted and would catch things if the phone was not in a case and are a bit sharp As for the protection it does not get scratched up like the plastic ones would or mine has not yet The last thing is some how the protector has cracked on one of the edges even tho the phone is in an otterbox i feel this happend due to the edge not being fully attached to the phone Even with the minor things i have problems with i would still get another ,negative
Ive always been a great supporter of the Zagg Glass shields This was the one time where I was only a little disappointed but the curved edges of the phone didnt help that So its not entirely the screens fault However the first day I accidentally dropped it the protector chipped in a couple spots Definitely a bummer Ive only had the phone with protector for 4 months and the wear is definitely noticeable after only a handful of drops a couple cracks 3 chips and one corner that no longer sticks down Nevertheless it has held up well The lifetime warranty is always worth it and Ill probably get a new protector through that soon ,positive
I gave 5 stars because the product itself is great in my opinion I love zagg glass screen protectors but this one is not the right fit for the Galaxy S7 due to the slight curve on the sides of the phone The shield stays uplifted on the sides which caused the shield to crack on the bottom right edge of the screen protector being that it does not lay flat on the phone screen It was installed at Best Buy at the time of purchase I will definitely continue to buy zagg glass screen protectors again for my other products but not for this phone unless the protector is slightly curved like the phone I would recommend this product but not for this phone ,positive
The clarity and smoothness are fantastic in the VERY middle of the screen but they didnt account for the curved edges of the phone even the standard Galaxy S7 has a fairly substantial curve This means the side edges of the screen protector DO NOT sit on the screen correctly and leaves a halo on both sides of the phone where the glass doesnt meet the screen which causes constant problems with touch screen functionality and looks ungodly Do not buy this ,positive
In less than a month I have used the warranty to replace a cracked screen protector and I already have cracks in the replacement I am a HUGE fan of the tempered glass screen protectors but have not had much luck with this one I previously had a Zagg tempered glass protector and I managed to go almost 2 years without cracks etc I dont feel that I have dropped my phone anymore than usual so Im not sure why I am having more problems Also it doesnt seem to seal completely around the edge there is 18 border that starts to look gross after a month I give the company props for offering a warranty though glass is much better looking than the film protectors ,negative
Only 3 compliments with 3 complaints 1Clear it makes your phone looks new2 Left no fingerprints or dirty marks on the center side of cover3 Its another glass on the glass so it might protect the screen very well if accident happensWhy minus the stars1 The size did not cover the whole actual screen2 Every edges of this protector didnt stick to the actual phones screen very well maybe because this product is too thick3 Because of the reason above it leaves room for dust or dirt to stay on the edges of my phone screen ,negative
Bought this as my 7th ZAGG screen protector and I am very dissappointed to say its a bad product that does NOT fit the Samsung Galaxy S7 device When I contacted ZAGG today after purchasing last night and discovering it did not fit properly they acknowledged that the products do not fit and while they are working on a Glass Curve that does fit it will not be out until 2017 They offered me the alternative replacement of the glass which I know from reviews doesnt fit or the HD Clear They can only replace and not refund products purchased from 3rd party sellers DO NOT BUY So sad to say they just lost a lifetime customer ,negative
See My review Feb 26 This product does not fit the Galaxy S7 not edge It is functional and will protect but leaves an one eighth halo on the outer edges where it can not adhere to the screen due to the slight curve of the screen on the standard S7 After one month of use I have not had the problem others have had with dirtlint collecting under the screen edges The new Zagg Glass Curve for the S7 is now available from Zagg However it still is not all clear The top and bottom are black opaque and will cover the color of your phone Until they offer an all clear Glass Curve I will continue to use this unit ,positive
Although this is designed for the Galaxy S7 it does not fit The S7 has a slight curve around the edge and this protector does not take that into consideration Best Buy unsuccessfully tried installing this three times before advising it is not designed properly to fit this phone If installed you will see a halo affect 18 14 around the whole phone This halo easily chips and cracks The sales rep advised Best Buy shouldve removed these from the shelves she removed the ones at this store Zagg is also aware this does not fit the phone properly and have come out with a curved edge version for this S7 ,negative
Got this shield 30 dais ago because of the clarity It is very clear and easy to clean But doesnt fit the S7 very well and there is a halo around the edge where it wont smooth down My husband dropped his phone 2 foot onto a rubber mat and it hit the corner pushing the cover against the halo edge which caused the glass to splinter Would suggest getting one that is a better fit or not glass Picture shows splinter and halo around edges Thankfully Zaggcom has a lifetime warranty ,positive
Like the previous reviews state it doesnt lay flat at the edges of the screen and I have the S7 When I was in Best Buy I asked the rep if the protector would go to the edge of the screen because my Otterbox one didnt and I asked if it was because the curve at the edges of the screen He said it would fit no problem but it doesnt I went to Invisible Shields website and saw they are coming out with the glass protector that will go with the curve for the S7 and Edge I added myself to the waiting list but I already threw out the packaging and the receipt for the one I have now so I think Im SOS ,negative
What can I say about zaggit truly is the best I use it for all of my devices and can not begin to explain the amount of money it has saved me Initial cost of 40 will tend to push some people away for a cheaper screen protector please resist this urge Ive literally shut my phone in between my car door and the body of my car with no breakage Once the zagg has crackedbroken just peel it off and send back for a FREE Warranty replacement Its that simple Purchase for almost any phone and computer screen It bets paying 100 ir more to get something fixed Trust me youll make your money back in no time ,positive
Ive been a long time user of Zagg Products and this one just dissapoints Ive had it fitted since I first got the S7 and already has a hairline crack across the screen and 2 pin point cracks at the edges of the screen Ive had Zagg glass fitted on my Apple ipod 5th gen with similar problems and had it for a while before I had problems Ive also had privacy glass fitted on my S5 with no problems at all First when applying it the left and right edges dont completely stick And now I have a couple cracks I havent had it for long and pretty disappointing it has only been a couple weeks ,negative
its rare that I am unhappy with something I was recommended to buy at your store but here you go it just happenedI just bought and it literally broke on installationits supposed to be a glass quality screen and WHILE I was applying it because the edge of the screen would not contact with the screen and I GENTLY pressed as recommended it shatteredof course I am going to ask for a lifetime warranty replacement from Zagg but I will have to pay for shipping this product is clearly a piece of junk ,negative
I have a reputation for cracking my screens quite horribly I am a bit clumsy with my phones With my most recent phone i decided to take a little more caution Id researched different screen protectors offered by best buy This was what I thought to be the best Ive had a few tumbles and the screen is still in great shape almost a month after purchasing the protector In fact i cracked the protector a tiny bit but it did its job the actual screen was safe My only negative about the product is that the edging of the protector doesnt go all the way to the out edge of the phone ,positive
I originally bought this protector on sale it was a nice deal since I figured it would be better than a plastic one for about the same price But I have to say Im disappointed The glass was pealing up at the slightly curved edges of the phone so dirt and dust could get under it I was also worried about it cracking there Ive never had a glass screen protector before so Im not sure if it was a problem I had or just a feature of glass ones but I found that I really had to press on the screen a lot to get the touch screen work I registered the warranty on the Zagg website but honestly I wont be replacing it ,negative
First things first these screen protectors are fantastic With thay being said this particular screen protector DOES NOT fit the S7 screen The screen of the S7 has a very slight but noticeable curve at the edges This screen protector lies flat and does not curve with the screen leaving a halo effect on the sides Over time dust and debris builds up underneath Zagg is currently working on developing a better screen protector for this phone Buy a cheaper one until that one is releasedTLDRIt doesnt fit the phone Buy a cheap protector until Zagg releases the new version ,negative
I paid 50 each for 3 Zagg HD Glass Screen Protectors for my 2 new Samsung Galaxy S7s and S6 phones ALL 3 of them cracked within 34 weeks of purchase Bestbuy covers 14 days so I had to deal with Zagg for the lifetime warranty Each time it took several weeks to get the replacement and they sent me the wrong model and also sent me the dry protectors instead of the glass This is the 3rd time I am waiting for them to send me the CORRECT replacements and I have only had the phones since 4816 Ive had cheap 5 protectors that have lasted the lifetime of the phones that were far superior to Zaggs in my opinion ,negative
Disappointed that this glass Shield cracked after two days However the sales associate at Best Buy put it on and told me that there are sometimes problems with this on the Galaxy S7 but never expected it to crack in 2 days Went online to Zagg to register and then also request a replacement and saw that Best Buy was 5 more then buying directly from Zagg Going in to the Best Buy store and hoping they will make this right by refunding me 5 as well as giving me a replacement so I dont have to go through warranty and wait a week to get a new one online ,negative
I got my phone early through a preorder from tmobile I was surprised to see this on the shelf so I bought it It fits poorly as the protection is flat and the Galaxy S7 has slightly curved edges around the glass I do not own the S7 Edge This makes it difficult to use the screen and keyboard sometimes as the borders of the glass stay somewhat elevated once applied This product should be recalled ,negative
This glass protector is a mess It doesnt lay flat on the screen so there is a lifted area around the edge of the whole phone which wouldnt be an issue except that if you look at it wrong it cracks I dropped a wood lip liner pencil on my phone and the edge chipped and cracked like Id just dropped it on cement Absolutely ridiculous for what I paid for it Replaced it once thinking it was a fluke then pulled my phone out of my purse to find the same issue from the phone just being inside of my purse Not worth the money Ill just buy a cheap replacement on amazon ,negative
I had the GEEK SQUAD install my cover at BEST BUY The results were not as well as I would have liked He broke the first one and got another off the shelf and then told meIf this one breaks or chips no problem just email the manufacturer and they will replace it It doesnt seem to fit the curve of the phone I purchased the name brand to go with that phone The cover is dull and not as transparent as I like I have purchased glass covers before and I have been satisfied The cost of the glass cover and installation was about 50 dollars I will possibly buy somewhere else and save money next time ,positive
There is a slight curve on the edges of the Galaxy S7 so the screen protector doesnt touch the whole screen I dropped it once on my kitchen floor and the corner cracked Theres already a ton of dust in the 18th inch gaps around the edge and Ive only had the phone for 4 days The only good thing is that I was told you can register your product online and get a lifetime warranty so you could keep replacing them but it may not be worth the hassle if you have to replace it oftenOn a positive note it does protect from scratches in the middle of the screen ,negative
I had the same thing for my S5 and the lifetime guarantee was a godsend I had to pay for shipping but I used it at least 45 times over 25 years Im not a fan of the otterboxlifeproof style screen covers personally But Im as clumsy as anyone and the screen wouldve been cracked many times over without the glass For the S7 the only drawback is this version doesnt bend to cover the curved edges So eventually the edges will get dirty Thats why only 4 stars But currently it seems like all the curved screen protectors dont stay on too well yet So this is a decent compromise ,positive
This particular Zagg shield for the Samsung Galaxy S7 has issues I have had at least 3 replacements since I got my phone last summer The way that it curves along the face of the phone is a slight bevel therefore dirt and dust and fuzz accumulate around the edges all the time even using an Otterbox My sons has cracked twice and every once in awhile we get them slightly defective out of the box Zagg is a super company with amazing customer service so returning it if registered online is never a problem but you do pay 599 for shipping and a new one is always sent out ,negative
For all our familys smartphones and tablets weve purchased InvisibleShield products The current Glass HD styles are very good Theyre easy to place on the devices screen and protect from wear and tear On a couple of occasions the protector broke but it protected the devices screen just as advertised With the lifetime warranty its a simple process to contact Zagg and a replacement shield is mailed Well continue to purchase InvisibleShield products in the future ,positive
If I could rate this product for zero stars I would Touch ability was not compromised The problem with this product is that you can not keep it on the phone long enough to get decent use out of it Samsung Galaxy S 7 The product will not lie flat on the screen edges it lifts on the screen edges causing air bubbles together between the protector and the phone screen Also it chips and cracks constantly The phone is not subject to a harsh environment it mainly stays on my desk or in my pocket Exchange process is poor Not recommended at least for this application ,negative
For the price you pay for the tempered glass you kinda think they would have the design worked out the Galaxy S7 Not the Edge has a slight curve to the screen This specific product is straight and will cause problems do not waste your money Zagg is aware of the situation but doesnt have a set time when they will have replacements for them you can see down below with the picture ,negative
When I dropped the phone this saved my screen But the downside waseven though you get one free replacement guarantee Make sure the Zagg Company sends you the right size After the broken screen was taken off it was discovered it was the wrong size So I had to buy another one from Best Buy in order to protect my phone The Zagg company was sorry and is ending me another of the correct sizeof which I do not need now Of course it has been over 3 weeks and I have not seen it I am not pleased with this situation ,positive
for big things big solutions our technology is increibe in a screen we have a complete world but that would be of the world without the adequate protections for our treasures smart phones screens cases and all that but the most incredible that a blink of applications you can handle from the lumimacion of your house asta video cameras and alarms is very interesting to see how the technology advances ,positive
Purchased this out of necessity after getting a new phone and wanted protection from day one Had this on for a day and it began detaching from the outer edges on both sides of the screen It also cracked from the slightest bump into a Formica counter top that fell from my hand that was laying on the table top Dont waste your money on this junk have had much better luck buying 5 ones that last longer and are much cheaper to replace since you still have to pay for shipping handling despite the supposed lifetime warranty to receive a replacement ,positive
Bought one at Verizon for my sons S7 and it was perfect I liked it so much I bought a second here at Best Buy for my S7 unfortunately it isnt perfect there is a 18th inch halo around the perimeter that allows particles under the screen protector I will contact ZAGG for a replacement I hope the replacement is better5 Stars for quality of the glass itself 2 Stars for consistency of their adhesive If you dont mind going back to ZAGG for replacements I would recommend if not dont bother ,positive
It is OK but I would feel safer with the glass protection I had on my S5 Because the Pt case is useless the case falls off when i am holding it and when the phone drops the case splits off immediately the screen protector started peeling off after I had it on for 20 minutes I even waited 48 hours after having BB put the Zagg on before putting the case on so this is absolutely a case issue but if it were the glass version it wouldnt be able to peel off so easilyVery disappointed overallcase screen protector wireless chargero ,negative
The problem is the slightly curved edge on the S7 Some screen protectors are short and just cover the flat part Others go edgetoedge but leave about 18 inch on each side that is not completely flat against the glass This one goes edge to edge It interferes a bit when typing at the edge like q p 1 0 or using the extreme edges but is something I got used to I use it with a Speck cover and havent noticed dirt or dust get under the edges even though I regularly run on dusty trails Ill put yes to recommend but really you decide ,negative
Great product good clarity good sensitivity with touch but As noted in other reviews it does not seal around the sides due to the rounding of the edge of the screen Pairing with a good case like and Otterbox or similar can help close the gap a little keep some of the pocket lint at bay I would recommend this product but with warning that it will probably have a shortened lifespan because of the ability of dirt and lint to get under the edge of the glass For that same reason I can only give it 3 out of 5 stars ,positive
I purchased the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 and only until after the Geek Squad installed it on my phone I saw that it did not curve where the phone did Matter of fact I ended up calling Zagg to ask if their product was made that way and the customer service rep I spoke with said it was indeed made that way and since the S7 was released theyve created the Glass Curve I was able to get a refund from Best Buy to purchase a screen protector that actually fit my phone ,positive
The screen protector does what it is supposed and protects the screen however the rounded edges of the Galaxy S7 create a halo effect The halo effect is due to the protector not being flush with the screen on the edges therefore making it very easy to crack Didnt have the phone more more than a week before I had cracks all over the protector just from normal every day use Had the same protector on my old Galaxy S4 and never had this problem in 2 years Im considering just taking the protector off because the cracks obstruct the view of the screen ,negative
First of all I want to say that Zagg is an awesome company with an incredible customer service department The are fast will do everything they can to assist you I have had their products on several different phones they were incredible I didnt read the reviews for this product because of the trust I had Big mistake Same as everyone else here i have the halo because of slight bevel in glass How it has got almost 4 star rating is beyond me Dont buy this BB take it off the shelf please Still waiting to hear back from Zagg customer service ,positive
As most I hate screen protectors mainly because its so hard to get the air bubbles out doesnt feel like a screen anymore With the invisibleshield its simple to put on doesnt take anything away from the screen Unfortunately after 2 weeks of use the screen protector accidentally lifted up I pressed it back down not expecting anything of it When I was able to take a look at my phone I discovered my screen protector had broken when I went to take it off it shattered in a glass shattering effect Its a great product but pretty fragile ,negative
Im not particularly excited about this product Pros easy to apply and through instructions it does protect my screen and is on the thick side very clear an no bubbles because of it being glass Cons because of the thickness I need to press a bit harder on the touchscreen doesnt lay flat on the edges cracked on the edge within 2 days and now there are many shatters along the edges Im guessing in part because of the lifted edges I think 40 is a bit too much to pay for this item but Im glad its at least holding up for protection ,positive
The product is good but after a few weeks the product is starting to lift at the corners of phone This makes for a annoying sight and continuous smoothing of the product that doesnt adhere to the phone anymore For the price i would think this wouldnt happen The product does the job and does not restrict functioning I wonder how long before it starts getting bigger and doesnt serve its purpose I paid Geek Squad to do the install of the shield to avoid issues like this I did read this was an issue but didnt think it would be immediate as it was ,negative
I wanted a good screen protector for my Samsung S7 The only problem is not the fault of the screen protector but because the screen on the S7 is ever so slightly curved Since the screen protector is glass it gets these tiny little cracks on the right and left side of it However this has not caused a problem with my use of the screen nor do the cracks expand I knew this might happen before I bought it as the salesperson let me know it might happen which was goodI didnt feel ripped off when it did happen ,negative
I recently bought a Zagg screen protector from a different retailer and it was terrible I felt it was my application that was the issue and a lesser version We bought a better version from Best buy and at first appeared to be better However the edges wouldnt adhere on either side Its exactly the same on each It looked like it should have been for an Edge S7 not regular S7 We checked to see if that was the case but it was notIts annoying but im not spending anymore money on a protector until I need to ,negative
I thought I would upgrade from the Zagg plastic protectors Ive used in the past and buy a glass one for my new Galaxy S7 Big mistake The glass on the phone is curved the screen protector is flat There is therefore about 5mm of the edge where the screen protector is not in contact with the glass The is going to invite dust and dirt between the phone and the protector Im returning mine tomorrow ,negative
My previous phone died but I had it awhile so when I got a new phone I had to get a screen protector Whoa The prices have gone up in the past few years That was an eyeopener but that said Im glad that I have a screen protector This product was easy to put on and take off if adjustment needed It doesnt interfere in functionality Overall it does what I need so while it was pricey to me it was also worth it ,negative
I have been buying Zagg protectors for years and this is the first time I have had a problem I have had this for about 3 weeks The Best Buy rep said that the halo effect would go away within a week What actually happened is the halo effect caused lint to accumulate and caused cracking at the edges within a week 3 weeks in and there are 4 chunks missing from the edges I keep this phone in my pocket about 90 of the time and have never dropped the phone It makes the edges of the screen nearly impossible to use Terrible product ,negative
The screen protector is easy to install clear easy to see through however the screen doesnt respond as quick or as well with it as with other clear protectorsAlso this unit had a small chip on the upper left hand corner which I decided to ignore The chip has been increasing in size and it looks as it theres another starting on the left edge about halfway down the phoneOnce this protector flakes to the point it interfears with the phone screen Ill take it out and get something else ,positive
Bought 2 of these when we upgraded our phones Supposedly these were the best ones they had for the Samsung Galaxy 7 We had the employee put them on before we left with the new phones The edges underneath the whole cover already has collected a ton of dust on both phones One has collected so much underneath that it got flipped up and cracked the corner of my screen shield Pretty disappointed since we havent even had them a full month Next time Ill just buy some cheap universal screen protector because those cost less and have the same result ,negative
I purchased the ZAGG shield primarily because I had cracked 2 screens on two of my phone in the last 2 months and it was on sale I bought it for my S7 and had the store associate affix it The end result is a 3mm perimeter that doesnt adhere to the glass Apparently even the regular S7 ie non edge is rounded on the edges This creates a visible line where the glass shield is raised above the phone screen and has the potential of collecting dust and making it more visible ,negative
I have purchased a lot of zagg screen protectors for everything from my cell phones to tablets and have loved their products This is the first product that has proven to be inferior in use The problem with this Samsung screen protector is the sides of the phone screen are curved down and the screen protector tends to come up off the sides You can not make it stay down and to take it up and try to reapply it does not work I would have thought Zagg would have came up with a solution to this before putting it out on the market ,positive
Love thr zaag glass screen protection and the feel of glass but not a fan of the s7 version that adds the pocket lint boarder The overall dimensions of the screen protector are perfect amd it feels great only downside is the s7 glass is curved slightly at the sides and the zaag glass is not You end up with a not so nice gap around the edges after about 2 days Then the pocket lint sstarts to collect and after a week you have a very visible lifted edge with fuzz Lifting it to clean only makes it worse over time ,positive
I started purchasing the glass screen protectors when i saw how it literally kept my wifes actual phone screen from cracking She cracked 2 different glass screen protectors but the phone itself was fine However the design for the s7 sucked The edges wouldnt stay down they seemed lifted I had to go back the day after purchasing to get a new one and while the associate tried his best even with the new one the edges wouldnt stay down so I had to purchase a different type of screen protector If zaag will fix the design it would be 5 star ,negative
Ive boughtapplied many Zagg glass screen protectors in my time Usually they are fantastic This was not the case this time The screen on an S7 is slightly curved on the edge obviously not as much as the S7 edge but a curve nonetheless is presentThe screen protector is just slightly too large and does not lay flush with the screen on the extreme edges Its not terribly noticeable but considering youll be looking at the phone all the time it will start to bother you ,negative
As with the several phones I have had these on in the past this screen protector has saved my actual screen from a great deal of damage This was a replacement for the same protector that I have had on the phone for about 18 months now While the protector was broken on most of the corners it did its job perfectlyThe protector WILL NOT seat on the edges of the Galaxy S7 because the screen is slightly rounded right at the edge This does not affect the protection though ,positive
The majority was right I was hoping the sides coming unattachedup would be minimal and I would just deal with it since I liked the idea of having the glass version of a screen protector WRONG the worst product Ive had yet Sides came up which then moved inward to the point that only the center section of the screen had the adhesive sticking Heed the warnings do not purchase The only saving grace is the companies replacement warranty which was used to replace it with a new option of screen protection ,positive
This screen protector is very pricey and should be perfect for the price Unfortunately it is far from it As other reviews have stated the edges of the screen protector do not adhere to the screen because of the slight curve It also does not reach to the edge of the screen to protect all of the front I should have kept my receipt because this product is not worth buying at all ,positive
Clarity and touch is great UNTIL it cracks on the edge For me it was the swipe screen to unlock that did it And then the hairline cracks start to appear and then it just becomes unusual The clarity is pointless at this point It started after only a couple of months A huge disappointment and waste of money I emailed zagg they said theyd replace it with the same onethe curved one is on backorder This product should be RECALLED best buy should refund the purchase price Bestbuy says to contact ZAGG ,negative
This is the best insurance you can ever buy to protect your phones screen I have dropped my phone on multiple occasions and at least twice I thought I had cracked the screennope it was only the screen protector which Zagg cheerfully replaced Do not waist your money buying a less expensive product because as they say you get what you pay for Also in addition to the protection of the screen the product reduces glare and allows for easy cleaning of smudges and fingerprints Again BEST accessory for a phone ,negative
I had another similar product which also worked great but I beat it up pretty bad while my phone was in a Fanny Pack I thought I actually broke the glass so I went to a Phone repair shop They directed me to Best Buy after telling me it was the cover not the Glass I damaged Best Buy installed it and until now I forgot I even bought it Its great and barely know its there Recommend for sure and recommend the Professional Install ,positive
This is my first time buying a glass screen protector an probably my last Ive always gotten invisableshield but never the glass Stick with the nonglass ones and youll never be disappointed I currently have 3 cracks and scratches and I cant remember dropping it ever in the last 3 months Ive had it any more than like 23 ft and its already trashed Not very thrilled It does NOT fit the galaxy 7 very well and theres a huge lift around the screen causing dust an junk to get in and make it look dirty ,negative
I used it for some time BUT I should have listened to the sales person who warned me that it does not fit perfectly on my SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 Cell Phone It had a 2mm ring around the whole display where it did not attach to the glass screen which is curved backwards I wanted some protection against scratches so I left it on until these edge which did not bend to the form of the glass collected to much dirt and i removed itSo 2 points for the time it workedBUT Do NOT use it for the SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 ,negative
I had read how the standard S7 has a rounded screen near the edges and that tempered glass protectors werent fitting quite right I was assured by BRB that this wasnt true for this protector Well it is So the left and right edges have 23 mm line along each edge that looks like a bubble but is just the curvature in the screen It doesnt affect anything but I was upset that the staff was either misinformed Still I would rather have my screen protected than not so I kept it Shouldnt cost as much as it does or the poor aesthetics ,negative
My Samsung 7 was going on 2 years and developed several cracks in the protective glass screen I went to Best Buy BB to see what types of glass screens they had The member of the staff recommended I go with the ZAGG Invisible Shield Glass Not only was it a drastic improvement in the clarity of the screen but I saved a considerable amount because it was on sale It was also worth the cost of having BB install the glass as they did a truly superb job Another well done for Best Buy ,positive
As nearly ever reviewer has noted the flat design does not fit the curvature of the glass on the edges of the Galaxy S7 From their web site I can see that they are working on a new one I understand that this happens when products are produced without the exact specifications I get that But I sincerely hope that I will not have to pay an additional 40 or more to buy the same product that I thought I was buying the first time ,positive
Its great for protecting my phone screen from getting scratched but honestly for the price I payed for this I dont like the way it collects dust and dirt around the edges one of the corners seems to want to come up and now I have a Crack in the bottom with a piece thats ready to break off right down by my button This isnt supposed to Crack or break and I havent done anything to it so I dont understand especially since it does have a case around it So for the enormous price I wouldnt do this one again ,negative
I BOUGHT THIS SCREEN COVER BECAUSE THE SALESPERSON SAID THEY WERE GOOD AND I HAD BOUGHT A THINNER CASE SO I WANTED THE EXTRA PROTECTION FOR MY SCREEN HOWEVER WITHIN DAYS THE SCREEN HAD SCRATCHES ON IT FROM SLIDING IT IN AND OUT OF PURSE I GUESS IVE IT A LITTLE OVER 2 MONTHS NOW AND THE SIDES OF THE SCREEN COVER ARE CRACKING OFF AT LEAST ITS THE COVER AND NOT THE ACTUAL PHONE BUT FOR THE PRICE I WISH I WOULDVE JUST BOUGHT THE CHEAPER ONES I CAN AFFORD TO REPLACE EVERY FEW MONTHS INSTEAD ,negative
I bought this for my new s7 after having great experiences with other Zagg glass screen protectors on other phones and tablets I installed it on my phone but it never really looked rightI noticed the edges were blurry and I was getting lint and other fuzzies stuck to the edge of the screen protector I then read reviews on BestBuycom and saw that many other people were having the same problems I pulled the screen protector off my phone and returned it to my local store Ill wait for Zagg to release the curved version ,negative
I had never had a tempered glass cover before just screen protectors Got phone out of purse one dayand the tempered glass cover was cracked At that point I had never dropped my phone or had it in any situation that would have caused that shattering of the screen protector That being said if there was a situation and I was unaware my screen was totally untouched However I went back to screen protectors only not the tempered glass Suppsed to have Gorilla glass anyway so I am saving my ,negative
Got a new phone and repurchase this for my new phone Both my husband and I had them for are old phones and we never broke our screen We did have to replace it once on my phone my preschooler launched my phone and 2 times for my husband hes just hard on stuff constructionmechanic Just make sure you register with Zagg right away saves time looking for the receipt later All in all 599 for replacement shipping way better than new screen protector or new phone because the screens broken ,negative
I returned a screen protector that I had bought when I first got my new phone That protector was supposed to fit my phone but kept coming up around the edges Went into the Best Buy Tracy and I talked to the department manager she determined that the problem was with the protector that I previously had purchased She installed the new protector and I immediately saw a difference She refunded me for my old one and completed the sale of the new one Surprised my wife and I as to the professional service we received ,negative
This product would be acceptable if it fit the phone screen properly Left and right sides of screen protector do not match the contour of phone screen you can see a border where the screen protector does not contact the phone screen This in turn causes the screen protector to interfere with the phone case on the lower corners screen protector peels up on lower cornersBottom line something this expensive needs to fit properly ,positive
Right after I bought it because of the stupid design The sides cracked They just came out with the correct design called the curve that covers the whole thing What an upgrade that one is AWESOME But forget about getting your phone wet Learned the hard way Once you put on the curve model and get it wet You will need to use the warranty as the water stays between the zagg and the glass of the phone 399 and got a new one on the way So make sure you dont buy this one for the S7 You need the s7 curve model ,negative
For a think piece of glass film it is pricey It doesnt appear to affect the touch screen and is able to stay relatively clean and clear smudge resistant It protects the screen well cracked in multiple places when dropped but my screen was undamaged The limited lifetime warranty helps so you can get a replacement if the glass cracks but the shipping fees are expensive for the free replacement Customer service for ZAGG has been great regarding the replacement ,negative
I have loved the glass products for my iPhones This one for the Galaxy S7 did not live up to expectations Even though my phone is not the S7 Edge the screen has a slight curve at the edges Since this Glass screen cover is rigid it does not follow the curve around the perimeter of the screen leaving a 2mm gap I realize that 2mm is not much but I would expect a product that is listed as being for this particular phone would have a perfect fit ,positive
In less than 30 days of use this item is cracked and there are 4 shattered edges When the edges shatter they are sharp like glass A piece got stuck in my finger and it was difficult to extract I do not abuse my items as the last similar product I had different brand lasted for over 2 years without any damage I have not idea why this product is so fragile The clarity is very good but the product itself is too fragile for general use I will need to return it for credit or replacement ,negative
I love the concept but the execution is poor Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect anything different but if you are going to provide a screen shield for a phone with a slightly beveled edge I would expect it either to work with the bevel or stop short so that the shield fully adheres to the screen This was never the case and I even paid extra to have it professionally installed at Best Buy From the very first the edges didnt adhere and began collecting dust making my phone seem dirty I finally gave up on it ,negative
The Samsung S7 has a slight curve on the edges which make this glass protector not fit properly It does not adhere properly as mine cracked within a few days and I dont drop or mishandle my phone My son also has the same phone but he has a heavy duty Otter Box case and his has not cracked He is more abusive with his phone Hopefully they have corrected the glass screen by now as I have had it about 6 months now Zagg does offer lifetime warranty so they do replace it you just pay for shipping cost ,negative
my old screen protector cracked when I rolled onto it doing some work in the garage with a bolt in my pocket the device screen was untouched so this purchase was pretty mindless the young woman that helped me knew exactly what I needed and installed it quickly and perfectly the screen is perfect and use is flawless with regard to the touchscreen performance I would purchase this again in a heartbeat and track down the young woman that helped me anytime I am in the store ,positive
Not only does it not contour to the screen of my phone but it also cracks very easily I have only had it a week and it has 3 cracks I know how one happened when it hit the countertop in the bathroom when I was putting it down No idea about the other 2 Very disappointing since I decided to pay more for quality Product is registered with Zagg but I dont even want a replacement if its just going to break again and again They still make you pay shipping and handling for a poorly made product ,negative
I was very excited to see that zagg had the screen protectors out early this launch but when I got home and put on the screen I noticed it didnt fully adhere to the edges of the screen Went back to return it right away Their pro at putting on protectors said it was placed perfectly and he didnt know why it was lifting Got my money back and went to an actual zagg store where they said that the curved glass wont be coming out for a bit ,positive
The screen does it job I wont argue that but it isnt like the video trailer describing the product claimed Hammers and fireworks werent supposed to damage this Its supposed to be military grade but on the bottom right corner not even a week after putting it on my teeth not even a hard bite cracks it A drop to the ground made a half circle crack The phone is protected to my knowledge but the screen shouldnt be damaged from this Not if it was as described ,negative
Purchased this product at the recommendation of a Best Buy employee who had used it on another phoneWhen I installed it i noticed the edges would did not make contact with the phone The S7 has a downward slope around the edge of the screen and because this product is not flexible it cant wrap around the screenVery disappointed with this product it really should be pulled off the store shelves ,positive
With the high price of cell phones today it pays to invest in a screen protector I have used the plastic screen protectors in the past and found that they make the screen a little cloudy and the images are not crystal clear This time I purchased the tempered glass protector and I am very pleased with it The screen looks perfectly clear and you dont even realize that there is a screen protector on The tempered glass may cost a little more but it is worth it and Zagg always stands by their products ,positive
I left the store with this applied Because it is glass it has no flexibility and the surface of the s7 seems to have somewhat rounded edges so it leaves this shield lifted up just a hair on the edges It cracked EVERY SINGLE TIME the screen hit something in my bag or pocket ZAGG was great super warranty but seriously do you want to replace it every week Go with a ZAGG top of the line screen protector made with military grade componentsbest screen protector ever ,positive
Normally I swear by Zagg products I have purchased many Zagg screen protectors at least 3 Zagg keyboards and one pair of Zagg earphones Before now I would give every product 5 stars But this screen protector is the first that began peeling up after only 2 weeks We let the Best Buy employee apply the protector so perhaps they did something wrong We have not yet contacted Zagg for a replacement I expect that their customer service will be excellent as it has been in the past ,negative
I dropped my phone and it landed face down on a concrete pad The screen protector cracked in many places BUT save my phone screen from even the slightest nick Way Cool I went and purchased another one at the store due to not wanting my phone unprotected while waiting on the shipping time then went through the process of paying 700 for shipping to get another protector from ZAGG I then returned the replacement protector to the store for a credit back to my account ,negative
Zagg glass worked wonderfully on my S5 However on the S7 the glass doesnt lay flat on the edges There appears to be a slight curve to the edge of the screen which prevents the Zagg protector from adhering on the sides I dont know if this will affect the performance of the screen protector or if it is only a cosmetic problem Zagg protectors have worked well in the pastfor me so Im keeping it on the screen for now I would recommend Zagg products but not this one for the S7 ,positive
I have this protector on my S7 As far as touch and swiping works fine No major scratches detected Problem is there is a halo effect on the outer edge of the screen protector Quite noticeable at first but you get use to it That halo problem becomes another issue when the edge of the protector cracks The phone is fine but the screen protector is now cracked at the edge which makes me wonder if the warranty is worth a dn Has the screen protector become compromised at this point ,negative
After trying generic glass screen protectors that were terrible I decided to bite the bullet and get the very expensive ZAGG branded protector I think the price is far too high compared to their competitors but I digress My main quarrel with this protector is that it collects dirt and lint on the edges since the screen is rounded Not sure if ANY screen protector can full cover the new Galaxy phones and I find that to be very unfortunate Otherwise this protector mostly gets the job done ,negative
Im on my second one in a month The first was applied by the BB sales guy on my S7 standard He said that it would seal on the edges overnight but that never happened It cracked within 3 weeks I used the lifetime warranty and got another from Zagg had to pay 5 shipping I applied the new one and its the same thing My guess is that there is a minuscule curve on the edges of the screen and the Zagg glass wont bend to sealDont bother with this product ,negative
Best Buy staff put the screen protector on my phone and there were a couple small bubbles I recently noticed that the screen protector has some large scratches on it The phone is usually in a pocket in my purse or on the counter There is nothing in that pocket of my purse where the phone is and there is no zipper on that pocket it is made for a cell phone and it hasnt fallen or anything to scratch it like that Not sure how good that fortified tempered glass construction is ,negative
Not to great of a product 1st you had to pay the price then pay to have a warranty then it is extra for them to put the glass on the phone I didnt pay extra to have it placed on on my phone for me as I thought it would be simple to put onWRONG ANSWER Now my warranty apparently doesnt cover any of it Wasted money like if that is the policy then please advise your customer Thanks for the heads up ,positive
There is another review about how this protector doesnt lay against the phone the edges are lifted I took a chance and that review is true I like how the protector is thicker which provides better protections but since Samsung S7 not the edge screens rounds off at the edges this protector doesnt seal all the way itll do for now until i pick up a thinner one that has more flexibility ,positive
I bought my new phone and put this on it to protect the screen Of course I dropped my phone a few times before i got a case that I liked The glass took the brunt of the drops This screen did crack after dropping the phone a few times but just around the edge My phone was perfect though Zagg honored their warranty and a replacement was quickly sent out to me without a lot of hassle Now I am back to a perfect phone again Well worth the price for the lifetime warranty that comes with this ,positive
Zagg usually makes excellent screen protectors but this one misses the mark I followed the instructions precisely and on a brand new phone since this is the autorecommended screen protector when you buy at best buy and the edges never adhered Its also just enough smaller than the phone that there is space between it and the edges of my very typical case After two weeks of light use the protector started shattering around the edges ,positive
I have always bought ZAGG and have always loved it until this item I never leave reviews either but was so disappointed I had to warn future consumers This screen protector doesnt touch the right or left side and is currently just collecting dust ZAGG says it was made for the curve of the phone and it obviously was not otherwise every review wouldnt be complaining about this Waste of 40 DO NOT BUY ,negative
I bought this when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 and it had a crack in one of the edges within the first day of just being in my pocket Since than the the cracks have spread all along the bottom and there are chips out of the screen protector all along the edges They also didnt account for the slight curve of the screen on the S7 and this lets dirt and dust build up along the sides of the screen For 40 this should have held up way better very disappointed ,negative
I have used this tempered glass screen protectors on all my phones They really do keep your screen from getting broken Dropped my phone many times I have never cracked my phones screen I have cracked the glass but never my phones glass They will replace it through their online site Its warrantied for life I have sent the old one back and received a new one for like 499 shipping charge only You only have to send the old one back so dont throw it away ,negative
I bought this screen protector and after dropping my phone from about 1 ft off the ground the screen protector cracked I received my replacement with my lifetime warranty however the new protector cracked on the edge just from being in my bag Its nice that you are able to replace it just having to pay shipping However its quite inconvenient having to go thru the process 2 time in just under 1 month Id stick with a screen protector that isnt made of this glasslike plastic ,negative
They all broke and cracked including the last one I had put on my phone I just feel that for the phone I have the screen protector should have a little more flexibility Each time I tried taking the cover off of my phone the screen protector cracked to pieces However this is the best one for my phone so I just think that because my phone is beveled not many options are available I have always used this brand and have had no issues ,negative
The Zagg cover for the Samsung Galaxy S7 is probably Zaggs worst product ever Its size is correct but Zagg didnt seem to anticipate the curved edges of the S7 screen So even with a phone case dust or pocket fuzz will get under the edges of the Zagg glass Not sure how this will play out long term but if you want the added comfort to protect your screen then buy one If youd rather send a message to Zagg that this isnt up to their high set standard then dont ,positive
When the shield was applied there was a fine line around the edges that remained dry no matter what we did It is slowly getting larger I have registered the product on Zagg and will pursue a replacement A post found online for this product had similar problem and was noted that some Best Buy stores had an incorrect product for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Hoping for a resolution for replacement from Zagg so althoough it seems like an ok product no recommendation yet ,negative
The glass is flat but the screen is curved at the edge so the glass does not adhere to the screen edgetoedge Any pressure on the side of the glass causes it to lose contact with the screen This also happened with the case I purchased in the store It pressed against the side of the glass I bought a UAG Urban Armor Gear case that is rigid around the glass and doesnt touch the screen I still have a halo around the sreen edge but it disappears when the screen is active ,negative
The screen protector cracked within a week of purchasing and I was not mishandling my phone Surprised for a product that offers a lifetime guarantee Its still on my phone and does protect the screen from scratches so havent bothered returning to get a replacement Also seems overpriced for what it is just a thin piece of plastic seems like it would cost only pennies to produce the kind of thing used as packaging that you would just throw away ,negative
This is a very pricey cover especially since it doesnt cover the entire glass like my original It is also not making good contact on the edge yes it is the correct model for my phone Best Buy tech warned me that this was normal for the glass Even so the glass is very smooth and phone is more responsive than with the original glass I purchased Overall it does what it is meant to and havent had any problems with it ,positive
Had best buy install the glass shield Had some concern because it is glass but the best buy salesman convinced me it was great Next day it was cracking on edges before long the screen was cracking everywhere Cant return to best buy tried but customer servicewas so sorry we dont stand behind our products go deal with Zagg However their return process is ok and let me exchange the glass shield for a plastic one which works great ,positive
Im very happy with this great product This was highly recommended by our Best Buy Rep who also gladly and expertly installed it It offers durable and lasting protection for my iPhone which is a major investment for me My wife and family have used this on their phones and this company has stood behind their replacement policies So Between my family Best Buy Rep recommendations it was an easy decision to invest in this extra protection ,positive
Bought yesterday and had it installed by best buy employee Was told that the edges of protector would adhere overnight Woke up to use phone and edge of protector cracked from light finger pressure Will be returning today Stay away until they make a product that works with the slight screen couture of the s7 ,positive
Ive used this product before on several phones and its been fantastic However because the edges of the screen on the S7 are slightly curved and the glass is apparently not there is a small gap between the two that causes shadowing along the edges and after a couple days of light usage the edges will begin to chip away This not only looks bad but causes a sharp edge that will catch on everything and could cause injured fingers ,positive
The screen does not fit the phone at all It cracks on the corners easily I have only had the screen protector for a month and had to replace it once because the corner cracked then cracked across the whole screen The second on I got the corner cracked and I even have a case on the phone This product is junk and I would not tell anyone to purchase these I was a hugh Zagg fan in the past and have always purchased them for my phones but never again ,negative
I have always heard good things about the zagg screen protectors so I decided to buy one when I got my s7 Worked well for about a week then I noticed a scratch that went almost down the whole screen Just from being in my purse and possibly my keys were against it Not good for claiming to be scratch resistant I already ordered my warranty replacement screen If you buy this definitely register it If this second screen scratches Im changing brands for sure ,negative
i was super excited about this screen protector because with the built in water resistance of the Galaxy S7 i knew all i would have to worry about is bumps and scratches however after application exactly according to the instructions the glass peeled up around the edges it did not conform to the shape of the screen very disappointing that said best buy customer service was excellent and upon seeing why i was dissatisfied refunded the purchase ,negative
The shield worked for a Samsung7 but I have the edge They stop making them for the Edge so I decided to try one for the 7 It worked but did not protect the EDGE of the phone It also caused a delay when i touched the screen Since the shield didnt fit the edges it collected a lot of dirt and looked old I ended up taking off the shield and getting a flimsy screen protector which only protects the screen against scratches not drops ,negative
The screen protector does not fit the curvature of the phone There is a halo around the edge of it that attracts dirt and dust particles Screen protector was damaged when trying to use the Gear VR Not sure if this was due to dirt under the edge or not Needed a screen protector at the time but if I would have known the fit I would have probably choose another protector The company was supposedly going to make a new protector so it fits properly ,negative
My girlfriend has it on her Samsung galaxy s7 not edge I noticed that I believe because the edges of the phone are slightly curved while the screen is not that the glass is not completely flush with the screen the other day she said she hit her finger on the screen by accident and she now has a small chip on the very top of the screen protector it is a good product you just need to be careful with it I would personally buy the glass curve the next time ,positive
So my favorite part about ZAGG is that they have an awesome warranty setup Seems in part because they really need to The protectors work but they are fragile and sometimes dont properly adhere to the device The adhering to the case is the issue that I experienced where it wont properly adhere to the edges Theyre cool about sending another though so well see if the second one has an easier time ,positive
I think that this product is a good sense of protection for my new Galaxy S7 but I wish the edges of the screen protector would have stayed adhered to the glass surface The edges are a bit cloudy due to the protector not staying adhered to the glass I even paid 7 for Best Buy employees to install the protector Maybe I will take it back and ask them to fix it Other than that it is a great product and I feel good about investing in this product ,positive
Dont buy for the S7 I was told how great the Zagg Glass Screen was Unfortunately I started seeing cracks along the edges and I hadnt dropped my phone When I went back to Best Buy where it was purchased and installed I was told that could happen if it was bumped against something I pushed back and the sales people finally confirmed with the Samsung rep that there was a known defect between the design of the S7 and the design of the Glass Screen ,negative
I have used zagg screen protectors and always been happy Purchased 2 Galaxys S7s and zagg invisibleshield glass protectors Within two weeks screen protector was coming loose on one phone and ended up breaking On both phones the glass protectors does not make contact with the curvature of the phone on the sides of the screen Luckily one of the phones has a case that covers the sides so screen protector cant catch on anything ,negative
This screen protector is a lot of money for a screen protector It is not worth buying The glass does not cover the edges at all It collects more lint then my dryer can It is very bad and I am very disappointed I bought 4 screen protectors from zagg prior to this one They all fit great This one does not fit well Find another screen protector this one will make your phone ugly ,negative
This was a lifesaver for my wife She got a cracked screen from a student at her school she works at and so after she got the screen replaced she bought this product and the same thing happened again except this time the Zagg cracked and not the screen You got a full replacement on the screen protector and shes back in business I recommend this to anyone who needs extra protection on their phone screen ,positive
I purchased the glass screen as a recommendation from the sales associate Paid the 8 to have him put it on Within two weeks it is peeling off and the edges have splintered and cracked in three different places I hope Zagg will stand behind their warranty but I also hope Best Buy will take accountability for a poor placement on the phone as well Not worth paying for the glass I never had issues with the plastic shield for 3 years ,negative
Theres been no noticeable decrease in touch sensitivity after applying the thick protector And it is THICK so unless you go at it with a saw youre not going to scratch the screen underneathThe only imperfection is around the edges The S7 not the Edge version still has a slight slope around its edges which this protector will not adhere to This leaves a small amount of room for dust or lint to get in there and get stuck to the adhesive ,negative
I had a Zagg glass protector for my Galaxy S5 and it served me well saving my phone many times When I upgraded to the S7 Edge I quickly bought this Zagg screen protector The edges keep peeling the included activator doesnt hold the protectors edges the protector is so thin that it is pretty much impossible to squeeze out all the air bubbles Its like cutting a piece of Saran or Glad Wrap and sticking it on the phones screen ,positive
This screen protector is 85 great Even though I have the standard S7 there is a small curve on each side built into the screen This screen protector does not match this contour so there are strips on each side of the screen without the screen protector adhering So far I have not had an issue getting buildup under these edges but there is a color difference between where the screen protector touches and does not touch the screen ,negative
I bought two new phones and this Zagg product for each phone Now three months later both Zagg screens are toast One has a crack running from top to bottom of the screen The other has several fractures that started at the edge of the screen and spread into the center I know that my phone one of the two phones has never been dropped In addition it is in an Otter case for safety Yet the Zagg shield is cracked from top to bottom ,negative
I tried another glass screen protector and the fit was terribleit didnt fit the edges and started peeling off from the top edges from the start Had to replace within 3 months This screen protector sticks to screenbut the entire rim looks like it has a uniform amount of air under it although besides for getting dust under it its still a better fit for an ill designed screen on the S7 ,positive
I was warned the edges of the glass would lift and it would be annoying I can see a lifted edge on my protector probably measuring 3 millimeters It doesnt bother me at all The screen is equally as clear with the glass it is equally as sensitive as without and I am happy with this product I love that if the company comes out with a new Zagg cover that does not lift at the edges I will be able to replace it with the new one ,positive
I paid 799 for someone at Best Buy to put it on and 2999 for the product After two days it started to crack along the edges I went back to Best Buy and due to the flu I didnt get there within the time frame so they had me call the company The company was wonderful and sent me a new glass shield free of charge The shield on my old phone is in perfect condition after 3 years but it is plastic not tempered glass ,positive
This is the first time I went with this type of screen protector So far so good I am glad the company offers life time warranty I upgraded 2 phones that day and decided that better quality accessories are worth a try We registered the protector immediately after the purchase and hope to never use the warranty but with teenagers and busy life styles something tells me we will eventually ,positive
Have had this for a few months now so far no cracks except for a small chip in the top corner where my phone landed in an otterbox case as well I do like the sensitivity it provides however the Samsung S7 has a slightly curved screen so dont expect this to reach the edges sides mine is a little less than 18 inch down the sides from making contact w the factory glassStill well worth it if you can get it on sale ,positive
I have used Zagg Shields for many years I have always had great luck with their product Being a very busy person and often grabbing up a pile of things and heading out the door is common for me This can cause problems when it comes to protecting the screen of your cell phone I have dropped my phone countless times from carpet to concrete floors Throughout these my screen has been saved by the Zagg shield ,positive
You buy this when want to be sure your screen is protected and never want to buy another screen protector This one has a lifetime warrantyOn the downside the edges of my phone screen are rounded so this protector doesnt fit perfectly and dust tends to collect under the sides Its also very expensive but thats why theres a warranty I have also heard that it does its job well being the thing that cracks instead of your screen ,negative
I was told this provides better protection on my screen I assume it has but it is cracked in 4 different places I feel like I havent been rough with it and the cracks have all come on different days My phone is really only about a month old That being said the protector is cracked but my real screen is protected and that is was it is designed to doprotectI also like how easy it is to get a warrantied replacement ,positive
The Galaxy S7 has an uneven front screen around the edges of the phone and I have been through 3 of these glass screens already because they start cracking from the outside in Ive got to take this one off because it is cracking from the outside corner again I think I am going to try the plastic instead of the glass Never had a problem with the glass screens before I actually prefer them just not for the S7 ,negative
I bought this glass screen protector and it crack the screen protector 2 days later It looked like my screen was cracked But they have unlimited replacement warrenty through zagg company So that was great My BF also bought the same glass proctector and it cracked on him as well He replaced it and it cracked again Its clear on the screen Your phone is protector Just hopefully we dont have to keep replaceing the screen protectors ,positive
Bought this product based on good experience with Zagg glass covers fro my S7 Unfortunately the sides of the screen curve a little bit and the cover will not adhere there I keep my phone in a case so other than it being a cosmetic issue it has caused me no problems No edge cracking yet I would NOT use this cover without at case though Zagg needs to find a fix and not just say to use a worthless polymer screen cover ,negative
Thick enough to prevent the screen from cracking and instead cracks itself if necessary But it does have a life time warranty that is a bit of a head ache to get a new 1 if it does break Better than the cheep screen protectors though Gave it a 4 due to the halo effects it has on my s7 not the edge Mainly shows when the phone is off or dark I can bairly see it while using the phone Overall the product servers it purpose ,negative
My little girl loves to carry around my phone and even though its a glass screen protector it still works extremely well I had a co worker that couldnt understand why i have it I promptly picked my phone up and dropped it on the cement floor She gasped loudly and when she saw there was no damage done to my phone i gave her a thats why look I love not having to worry about my screen getting shattered if my phone is dropped ,positive
Hands down the best product in this category Zagg has been continuously perfecting their craft since the beginning They dont interfere with cases and you hardly notice they are installed But they add the highest level of protection for your screen When ever I take it off the screen looks brand new They also have great customer service and provide replacements as part of the warranty ,positive
First zagg screen Ive bought that Im not satisfied with They didnt make this to fit the slightly curved screen edges on the Galaxy S7 so it just cracks Its holding up ok where it does fit flush and Ive dropped my phone with no damage But it has cracks where its not flush and I have a feeling it will continue to crack until I have to replace the whole thing Hopefully they make another one to fix this issue ,negative
This screen protector was selected by the sales associate and as stated on the package by the manufacturer is for the Galaxy s7 It protects well and feels smooth with no bubblessort of The edges of this screen cover do not exactly fit the edges of the s7 not the s7 edge and its works fine but it is slightly disappointing I think that Zagg has since released a new one and admitted that Opps this didnt quite fit ,positive
I upgraded to a Galaxy S7 three weeks later I went to California to visit family We went on a tour and as I was leaving the bus I dropped my phone face down and the screen cracked I never cracked a screen before So with much paranoia and many reviews I decided to purchase this to protect my phone So far its great I can rest know that my screen is protected and this protector has a lifetime guarantee ,positive
Ive had this same screen protector for my past phones and loved it The ONLY thing that I dont like about this one for the Galaxy S7 is that the sides dont completely adhere to the phone About 4mm not sticking to the phoneas if the phone is beveled So when grabbing my phone with another item in my hand the part not adhered cracked Still better protection than without itand it offers keeping great sensitivity for touch ,positive
The screen protector seems to hold up against drops and scratches Although it does not lay flat on the new Samsung S7s screen I am guessing due to being tempered glass it will not contour to the bend in the cell phones screen This bit of room leaves an error in space for dirt lint and dust to get under the edge of the protector and I am sure over time will cause the adhesive of the protector to stop working ,negative
This is an exceptional product Ithe redefine the next level of screen protector Aside from protecting the screen itseems easy on the eyes and finger motionHowever the installation was horrible The wait time was long plus the installer left an hair between the screen protector and the my cell Never advise if I can return to get it fixedWill not return to this particular best buy and any recommendation ,positive
The Samsung S7 standard model has a slight curve on the edges of the screen It is not a dramatic curve like the Samsung S7 Edge The Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 leaves about 1 centimeter on each side left and right that does not adhere to the screen The screen still functions but eventually the gap under the screen protector is going to fill with dust and lint ,positive
This is a must for any phone I feel It gives you extra protection for your screen I have seen so many phones with the screens shattered because of a simple drop and you cant even use the phone other than answering a call The extra protector saves the phone just in case it hits the floor Phones are so expensive these days and I cant afford to replace them so the protection I get from the protector is so worth it ,positive
I had a great experience with Zagg screen protectors in the past they honor the warranty and customer service is excellent This specific product has a design flaw and the edges do not follow the slight curvature of the screen so it stays up preventing a perfect fit The level of protection though is still amazing Im still a Zagg glass customer but the issue on the edges is the only complain ,positive
I have had InvisibleShield protectors for other phones and know that they will replace the protector is it gets damaged The cons for this one is that with the Galaxy S7 you will end up with a border on the screen Customer support said that it is due to the S7 screen being beveled slightly Also around the border I have to press harder for the phone to recognize my touch ,negative
Although stating that it is for the Galaxy S7 it does not come close to fitting the phone Why a company would make a flat piece of glass to protect a CURVED screen I dont know Why a Best Buy associate would sell this product is also puzzling Very unsatisfied complete waste of time and money Gave it a single star only because at least one star was required ,negative
I have only had the protector on my phone for over a month and its already cracke I havent had any major drops with my phone I thought this product was supposed to be shatterproofI have had other protectors on my phones and tablets that seemed to be able to withstand small drops without scratching chipping or cracking I will definitely be replacing this product through the lifetime warranty in the near future ,negative
I have had TWO of these things crack and break on me and not from falling or being struck or anything Just taking it out of my pocket and there is damage to the sides and once there is one crack like anything glass it just cracks more and more over timeZaggs lifetime warranty is free but you have to pay a minimum of 6 for shipping and I dont want to pay 6 every two months for a screen protector ,negative
The Zagg Glass Screen protector may turn out to be a wonderful protective product But right now I have to rate it soso The reason is that despite the store installing it there is still an edge that did not adhere fully The store said that was normal that despite their best efforts there is usually one corner edge that does that Given how expensive this product is that is most frustrating ,positive
The glass screen protectors are the best I have a big dog who loves to jump up and hug you and hes knocked my phone out my hands so many times hes even hit the screen with his claws Let me tell you Ive had to replace my protector at least 4 times cause its crackedbut my s tual phone screen is fine the glass zagg protector absorbs all the damage so your phone screen doesnt ,positive
Worst screen protector Ive ever owned Day 2 of having it on my new phone I already started noticing little cracks around the edge of the protector A week later my son accidentally dropped a set of keys on top of it and cracked the entire protector and part of my screen At 40 I would expect better protection than that I will never purchase another one of these ,positive
Before I had children I never needed any sort of glass shield product for my phone Ever since having little ones my phone is constantly dropped and this is the best option for it Despite all the drops my glass has NEVER been broken If you get the warranty with ZAGG in which a Best Buy agent hinted I should get they will send you a new one whenever the old one gets to broken up ,negative
This was a replacement purchase My first screen protector lasted almost three yearsbut dropping repeatedly caused a crackwhich didnt have any effect on the phone There was a recent ding as wellso decided to replacejust to be safe This one is working welland Im trying to be more carefultoo ,negative
Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 was an upgrade from an regular plastic feeling screen protector The upgrade was suggested by an employee who asked me to feel the difference from my old cell phone to his cell phone that that the glass protector on it I purchased the Zagg invisibleShied glass screen protector for the new Samsung S7 The feel of the glass protector is solid ,positive
This screen protector was recommended by the sales associate I liked the idea of the glass versus plastic and the lifetime replacement warranty The clarity is fantastic and Im pleased with it so far I have only had the phone etc about a month so havent really tested the limit of the protection as far as dropping and screen breaking but the protection from scratches and daily usage seems very good ,positive
Cracked not too long after I got it I was too lazy to swap it out Had it for less than a year now its so cracked up and chunks missing The edges did not stick down properly yes I cleaned the heck out it first Terrible product I have a decent case on my phone so theres no reason for it to have gotten as cracked up as it is from accidental drops ,negative
I bought this Zagg screen protector for my cell phone It does what it is supposed to doprotect your screen from scratches It is a thicker adhesive plastic but a pain to try to put on the phone yourselfthe staff at Best Buy will put it on your phone for youbut BEWAREthere is an ADDITIONAL 800 CHARGE for the Best Buy staff to put the screen protector on your phone ,negative
I decided to save the 799 cost to have Best Buy install this screen protector BIG MISTAKE The instructions were so confusing and by the time I got the screen placed correctly on my phone there were finger prints at the bottom that would never come out Money totally wasted I have installed other brands with no problem But if you buy this brand at Best Buy let them install it Lesson learned ,negative
Zagg does it my previous screen OB protector had chipped then cracked and I needed to replace Best Buy will even pricematch to Amazon Easy to follow instructions for install Also has lifetime warranty should when it cracks just register on Zagg website Note the glass doesnt fully adhere to the slightly tapered edges of my Samsung Galaxy S7 but hasnt caused any issues Very satisfied ,negative
Because its glass and the edges of the phone are beveled the edges of the screen protector dont adhere to the screen leaving a 2mm gap all the way around I had the plastic version in my hand and the sales girl talked me into getting this one instead because glass is so much better So I trusted her and spent more money on a protector that I had to remove and throw away Total waste of money ,positive
Seemed like a good idea at the time buying something to protect such an expensive phone Within a week of having it in place it had shattered along the edge of the camera after sharing my pocket with a golf tee It since has cracked in a few other areas along the edge The phone itself remains usable and and the screen itself seems undamaged but aesthetically it doesnt look great ,positive
Had this screen about a week before it crackes on the side of my s7 not even an edge S7 A month later it cracked again I signed up for the lifetime warranty but it costs 8 for them to send a new and it costs to hace Best Buy put it onsome lifetime warranty I feel like it protecta my screen well because it is so thick but my fingers are taking a beating from the cracks ,negative
The thought of a glass screen over a plastic one sounded like a great idea since mine was damaged by keys in the same pocket The glass is very good to look at Theres only one flaw transferring of pressure from your finger to the real screen isnt perfect That can be annoying Other than that Im happy with this product ,positive
I bought this product at the same time that I got my phone because of the risks of dropping it I guess it serves its purpose for now The sides of the glass dont stay adhered to the screen because of the screens slight curve So Im sure eventually something will catch one of the raised sides of the glass and either break it or pull it off the phone Dont waste your 40 or so dollars on this ,negative
I have used Zagg since 2006 on all of my mobile devices and have throughly enjoyed the quality While I understand that as of now no glass screen protector will fully fit the curve of the S7 why would you sell this product I am waiting for the release of the new curved glass from Zagg just not happy with the quality and decision to release an inadequate product ,positive
I love Zagg have for a long time But this one really fell short The edges dont lay down because of the slight curve to the phone It messes up the screen and looks down right awful For the price Im angry I emailed customer support through Zagg and they essentially shrugged me off Dont waste your money or time ,negative
Ive never been known to break a screen so I just wanted to get a regular screen protector Unfortunately they only had these 40 glass protectors but I figured I would never have to buy another protector Boy was I wrong It started cracking in two spots around the edge the day after I bought it I never once dropped it to cause it to crack I will not be purchasing this product again ,negative
Do to the edges not making contact with the screen the protector cracks on the edges it cracked the day after it was installed This has happened on mine and my wifes phones We are very careful with our phones and they are always in perfect condition when we trade them in I am waiting for the Zagg new curved lens cover I hope it is replaced with no issues ,negative
I used to trust ZAGG products But after this one I would not buy another ZAGG product for Samsung See my photo The gap is very noticeable on my S7 worse than on my Note 4 There is another one supposed to correct this problem but its only sold on ZAGGs website at higher price ,negative
Any time one uses a cell phone it can become abundantly smudged with fingerprints from texting and all other kinds of air contaminants and debris during a normal daily usage These types of soilings arent easily removed but with a invisible glass shield they can be removed from the screen easier and the brilliance can be returned to the viewing area much better than if the shield werent present ,positive
I bought this thinking it was the new glass protecter for the S7 It isnt So far ZAGG doesnt make a glass screen protecter for this device The one that they did have which I bought doesnt adhere around the perimeter of the phone It does provide protection but wont look right and will get dirt and small particles under the screen I would suggest you get another kind that fits ,positive
This screen protector forms a halo around it It appears as if it was lifted and after a while it started cracking from one side and then from another side Given that they come with a warranty I will be contacting ZAGG to get a replacement but I would give it some time in oder for them to fix this issue I wouldnt recommend anyone to buy it right now Give it some time until ZAGG fixes this problem ,negative
I have always liked Zagg screen protectors but the fit on the Galaxy S7 leaves a little halo on the edges because of the phone design Dirt and lint from my pockets have started to collect under the sides making it a short lived protector if that kind of thing bothers you The durability on the other hand is fantastic the glass screen protectors make me feel much more at ease about accidents ,positive
I always get Zagg screen protectors for my phones as they usually dont disappoint However this one could definitely be better Theres a Halo around the edges of my screen protector due to the S7s slight curve near the edges I have a regular S7 and not a S7 Edge and there is still a slight curve on the sides of the regular S7 With the halo showing dirt will build up under the screen protector ,negative
This item is horrible Zagg and Bestbuy sell an item THEY KNOW isnt going to fit the phone Why this item hasnt been taken off the selling floor is beyond me AFTER you buy it they tell you it doesnt fit the phone rightwell if you know that then get rid of it My cover cracked days after getting it because the cover is flat and the phone is slightly curved at the edges ,negative
I am a huge fan of Zagg shields for most every phone Ive ever owned Unfortunately it does not fit the S7 properly Due to the slight curvature of the S7 screen the screen protector does not adhere solidly around the edges and leaves what they call a halo effect This effect really bothers me and its hard because it leaves a different color than the rest of the screen protector ,negative
Ive used Zagg products for years and cant say enough good about them Their support and lifetime replacement policy is outstanding If the protective cover cracks gets scratched etc you go online or call and they ship a replacement always had mine within 3 days for only the minimal shipping cost Put the new one on and send them back the damaged one in the provided postage paid envelope ,positive
Liked the touch and feel of the glass shield protector however with the S7 not the edge the edge of the screen is still slightly beveled This protector doesnt account for that design and per best buy personnel a known issue Eventually returned the item as there was a halo effect around the perimeter which eventually collected pocket lint and obscured some of the viewing screen ,negative
We didnt notice it at first but after using the glass shield for a while we noticed there was a sensitivity issue when trying to use certain numbers or letters on the keyboard while texting This really bothers me bc I consider myself to text fairly fast and the issues causes me to have to go back and correct a lot before actually sending the text ,negative
Love the glass screen its worth paying Best Buy a few dollars extra to put it on properly my screen is clean and smooth definitely worth the money to protect my screen too many people have broken their screens just make sure you register your screen we use the OtterBox case and put the glass screen on it best protection no problems can hear clearly its wonderful definitely highly recommend ,positive
I dont care about the lifetime warranty Im more worried about the fact that it does not sit flush on the left and right side like others have stated Big 40 disappointment I bought Zagg instead of a cheap Amazon generic for a reason and I was let down ,negative
It was easy to put on and it has stayed on with no issues It is very clear and cleans up easy with a microfiber cloth The only thing that I didnt like is that there is a space around the edge of itOn both the right and left sides there is a 38 or so area where the protector is not on the phone which leaves a noticeable strip on both sides Other than that it has worked good ,positive
The shield itself is great but my daughter broker hers less than a week afterwardyou have to go on line enter the warranty info mail the broken on it you remove it yourself send for shipping and handling and then about a week later it shows up in the mail Then you can install it yourself or go back to the store where the will install it for free Wheeeeeee what a deal ,positive
This screen protector does not fit correctly on the galaxy s7 The screen edge on the galaxy phone is curved just enough to leave a noticable bubble around the entire edge of the phone It does not adhere to the phone completely It has been installed for a couple weeks now and the bubbles have not gone away I would not recommend purchasing this screen protector ,positive
I can honestly say that this product is worth the money I have put the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector on all of our phones I know from experience that they work after accidently dropping my phone the shield cracked which is replaced for free when you reach out to the company but it saved my phone and now that we have to lease phones the Zagg protector is a must ,positive
I had it on my S5 and it was great so I decided to put it on my S7 and it doesnt sit flush on the sides I dont like how it looks but I have kids so what can I do Plus Im not sure its the phone or the shield but my buttons are less sensitive to the touch So I would recommend if you dont mind it not sitting flush and having kids but if your not going to drop your phone dont get it ,positive
Had it installed for two weeks and its already saved the phone My wife dropped her phone and the screen protector took the hit and broke instead of the screen The lifetime warranty is a complete pain in the behind though Almost as cheap to go buy a new protector after all the shipping Ive definitely seen less expensive options out there Still better than 599 for a new phone though ,negative
Had this product installed when I upgraded my phone It didnt seal all the way to the edge of the screen I was told to register for the warranty and then go thru the company to have it replaced for free Have tried a second one with the same issue Not really a free replacement if I have to pay 599 shipping each time Haven ’ t decided if Ill try one more or just go my money back ,positive
They should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this It doesnt fit the slightly rounded screen of the S7 and I guarantee you they dont have one that fits the edge Within 24 hours the edge of my screen protector was cracked Zaggs fix to this problem was to send me a cheap screen protector They have no idea when the screen protector that fits the phone properly will be released ,negative
This is the best protection for a phone ever I had one on my previous phone I dropped the phone one night while I was getting our of my car It hit the ground face down I couldnt see it so I ended up stepping on it and slide on it across the concrete My actual screen was saved The shield had to be replaced but all I had to pay was SH since I registered my product Super pleased ,positive
The original shield protected my phone when it fell on concrete It cracked and the company offers a lifetime replacement I bought this to put on my phone while waiting to get the replacement shield It came fast and should I break it again I will have one to put right on while getting another replacement Best Buy put it on my phone for me too ,negative
Very disappointed Previous protector lasted over 2 years with barely a scratch Within 1 week this had a sizeable crack across one corner from picking it up by the corner Will be taking advantage of the replacement program Hopefully that will go smoothly and next one well be better as these are rather expensive to have to deal with poor quality My husbands has been good so far ,negative
This Screen Protector cracked only 3 after I purchased the item and it cost 6 or 7 dollars to ship the replacement and then you have to pay to ship the bad one back The last one I got took nearly 18 months to crack when they crack they are usually hard to see unless they are in just the right light even with a cracked screen protector you are still able to do almost everything ,negative
This is the best screen protector if you are a phone dropper With young kids around my phone and accidents happen I have never had a cracked screen The glass cracks if it hits right but you just peel it off and replace it and the actual phone screen underneath is fine I highly recommend this product ,positive
Best Buy charges 8 to place it on my phone SeriouslyPlaced it on my brand new phone Even though they used the rubbersilicone squeegee it still has air bubbles under it in several places Its already chipped on the edge Less than a month oldWorst screen protector Ive purchased and at least double the price of any Ive ever purchased Im not pleased at all ,positive
The salesmen did mention and show me the fit of the Zagg glass on the S7 and while it does not fit flat against the display I am hoping that it does not affect wear although it is a reason for concern I only purchased it 4 days ago so no issues as of yet I was not offered an alternative so I went with it hoping for the best as I was very happy with the Zagg glass for my S5 ,negative
Been using these for years and have broken two of them but the screen is perfectly fine Saves me 110 repair costs every time I break one Their offer of sending you a replacement cover if it breaks is incredible For cost of shipping and handing you get a brand new one Be sure to ask BB to price match as you will find it cheaper elsewhere But BB will match it ,positive
Like everyone else said I purchased this today after getting my phone early from ATT and the glass doesnt fit the phone It looks and feels great in the middle but there is definitely a halo around the edge of the phone due to the curved edge on the S7 ,positive
We are longtime zagg buyers but for some reason which apparently is common the glass screen for the galaxy s7 does not fit very well The edges do not lay flat on both sides the edges are sligtly lifted up and not completely on the phone Otherwise I love using the zagg glass screen protector but I think samsung tweaked the phone a little too much with a curve ,positive
The screen protector works as expected and advertised not only does it protect but it seems to to enhance the screen color and clarity My only challenge was getting a perfectly clean screen so the protector went on without specs on the screen I have 2 specs of dust on my screen that I can not see when the phone is on but you can tell its there was a black screen ,positive
This Glass Screen Protector has saved me several times I happened to enter and see a customers broken phone A Rep pulled the top piece off and the phone was UNBROKEN Within a few weeks I dropped my phone and saw cracks everywhere After pulling off the protector MY phone was perfect NOT ONE Crack I immediately went and replaced the shield I will not be without one ,negative
Good cover easy application In my opinion SUPER expensive but was convenient to get it right at the store versus online If youre looking to save cash think ahead and order ahead But in this case Id say you get what you pay for I use a case that doesnt have a screen protector but no screen problems from normal use or dropping here and there thanks to this product ,positive
All was well until the screen protector wouldnt set properly I expected a lot from this especially because it was so pricey and was recommended by a friend I did everything exactly as the instructions said The protector just doesnt fit the phone c ,positive
At first I was told that the edges would settle to the curvature of the screen That did not happen With a little checking I found out that zagg for whatever reason was not aware of precise specs for the S7 phone Zagg has announced a new curved screen for the S7 on their website to be available soon but they dont know exactly when ,positive
This is my second screen protector first replaced free by Best Buy for same reason pulling sway from the screen on all 4 corners now up the sides I have a case on my phone also I have searched cant find any other screen protectors for the S7 Edge DO NOT PURCHASE YOU DO NOT GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR EVEN THE SCEOND TIME AROUND ,positive
At worst the screen protector has already cracked within about 2 weeks time from light pressure on the phone between being in my pocket or lightly rolled over on in bed which ends up getting moved to the night table after that realization its meh at best and I was upsold on it and didnt realize it till I left the store as the case I bought had a screen protector in it ,negative
I would never buy a phone again with one of these screen protectors I had my new S7 for two weeks and dropped it one time the case I had didnt help at all the screen protector cracked but the phone screen was unharmed I took it to a Zagg kiosk all the mall and they changed it out in just minutes No question asked Although it cost me me 1600 to get the new one installed ,negative
Best Buy installed the shield for me Zagg has a great warranty which sells my use The shield looks good Went on very well Only negative thing that may or may not be the shield seems like the screen may not be quite as sensitive to swipes as the older flexible film It may be just me but that is the only concern I would have Swipes work just not always on the first time ,positive
I was disappointed in this screen cover It cracked in two places before I had it for two weeks Best Buy said they were getting a lot of the covers in that were warped which in turn caused cracking After contacting Zagg they are sending a new one but wanted to charge a 599 shipping fee I talked them into waving it this time since it was a defective screen cover ,negative
Not crazy about how the screen protector fits the screenhas a halo effect all on both sides and makes the screen less sensitiveThe first one I had cracked on the edgethe one the store tried to n put on my husband phone cracked as they were putting it onNot very happy with the over all look and use of the protector I would not buy this again ,negative
This is my second time purchasing this product it totally protected my screen when my kid dropped phone on the bus and I didnt want to wait for mail shipment so I repurchased itThe cover cracked as if it was glass and my child was scared to show me phone when he came home but all was well screen protector worked as advertised ,negative
Top right corner of shield separated from screen surface on 1st install by Best Buy associate I returned for credit under 14day warranty and another BB associate installed 2nd one which is now having the same problem but in both top corners where it curves around the center cutout Twice makes me think it is defective design Plan to consult BB again ,negative
With this installed on an S7 you can not use anything near the edge of the screen due to the fact that it doesnt conform to the slight curve of the phones edges No I dont have the curve version of the phoneI dont usually do negative reviews but this product does not work for the phone it is sold for ,negative
I have had Zagg screen protectors on my phones in the past It is a great product However though it was listed to fit my Samsung it was too wide and hung slightly over the edges This was not just one screen protector but the same for the other two that I bought for the other new phones that I bought Best buy was willing to take all 3 back if I was disatisfied ,positive
The screen protector does what it is supposed to do HOwever on the Samsung S7 it does not fit the edges of the phone well and does not adhere well This is not the EDGE phone but the regular phone There is also a charge to ship it and to install it Total cost is about 13 to replace the class screen Zagg customer service is GREAT however ,positive
40 for the screen protector and another 8 to have it installed seemed a bit high When other places will put the screen on for free But in the long run its a good investment on a 700 phone It does not effect using the phone and you cant even tell its there My only suggestion would be for the screen to attach on the edges Dirt gets trapped there easily ,positive
Ive had zagg glass protectors before and they worked great though I had undesirable warranty customer service from zagg but they are not for the S7s curved screen I was warned about the halo effect and that the edges might crack a bit but that happened after Id had it 2 days and had not dropped it I ended up with cracks all across my screen with no origin points ,negative
I have not had any problems with the screen protector but had I read the reviews I would have bought a different one The S7 basic model has a slight curve on the edge of the screen This glass screen protector is completely flat and does not cover the curved edges I bought this instore and did not think to read online reviews while shopping ,negative
I have had these on my last 2 phones and they fit really well and did an amazing job at protecting the screen I upgraded all of our phones to S7s and have had to replace 3 of these already in just over 1 month They dont fit well where the edges on either side of the phone dont actually sit against the screen Pretty poor for the S7unfortunate ,positive
Work outside so was looking for more protection for my screen Had one with the last phone and wanted to continue that One suggestion if you buy the Otter protective case for your phone there is also a screen protector in the box so you dont have to buy a separate one like this This screen protector is good but just sayin ,positive
Zagg makes great screen protectors and I used theirs on my S5 for 2 years But somehow with the new design of S7 the curved edges etc the screen protector gives a very poor tactile experience I was doubting the quality of the phone but realized that it was the screen protector which was messing up my interactions rather than the phone itself ,negative
4 mm halo around the entire screen had the sales associate apply and she tried 2 and they were both the same seriously annoying because it was the same with the s6 until they recut the glass after customer complaints why did I assume that the s6 illfitting screen was an isolated error would leave no star if I could ,negative
I bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S7 phone I did NOT buy the Galaxy S7 Edge However the new S7 screens are still slightly curved at the edges Zagg did not compensate for the slight imperceptible curvature of the new phone screens As a result the edges of the Invisibleshield Glass do not adhere to the screen Dont buy until they fix the problem ,negative
this shield does not fit properly it is a good enough protector to use until zagg comes out with a newer one that fit the screen better it seems that the new galaxy s7 phones have a bit of a lift on the edges and this glass protector does not conform to the lift per a zagg rep the new shields coming out soon should be able to conform better to the phones ,positive
This is actually the second GlassShield Ive purchased for the same phone since it was purchased about 8 months ago I had radiating cracks in two to three spots on the shield and decided to replace it before it got worse However it did its job in that the actual glass on the phone screen is still pristine Hoping this second one lasts a little longer ,negative
I am a dropper I drop my phone at least once a week I put this screen saver on when I purchased my phone and it protected the screen as it said it would The glass protector cracked in several places instead of the actual phone screen cracking Still worked when cracked ,negative
I got this and Im not sure if it was a good purchase I may be saving my screen from scratches but the sides of the protective layer doesnt reach all of the screen and there are cracks in it I now have to research on how to get it replaced Not even a full year and Im not that much of a hard user of my phone ,negative
Covers most of the screen side of the phone and protects it from damage Dropped my phone once and the protector cracked slightly but the phone is fine Has a border that looks like the protector isnt making contact with the screen Not sure if its suposed to do this it all the way around Looks weird But it still provides protections so i deal with it ,negative
The thin glass does cove the whole are of the phone However as the screen of the Galaxy S7 has a slight curve on the edges the glass cover does not bend with it As a result the edges of the screen are not glue to the glass When the screen is on it makes no difference But you can see it when the screen is off Still it does protect your phone ,positive
I had this product on my Galaxy S4 and it worked great On my s7 It feels like my touch response is impeded The touch is not responsive without multiple tapping Now my phone just completed an update and this issue may be resolved Quite frankly I have not had the opportunity to test it All in all however it does a good job of protecting the screen ,positive
The screen protector is better than other Zagg products I have had The glass is slick and feels like the screen on the phone itself I got the S7 when it first came out and this screen protector did not seal along the sides of the phone where it was slightly curved I was concerned about the screen protector coming off It has not and I have had it over 2 months ,positive
This protector does its job and save the screen from small scratches although it does not fit the S7 like it should so the Halo effect is a serious issue I went through more screen protectors for this phone than ever before Finally got upset enough i just got tired of wasting money on it I traded the phone in on the new Note8 ,negative
Since the sides of my Samsung Galaxy S7 curve on the sides I had to return this glass screen protector for a plastic one Im very disappointed as I know that the glass screen covers protect much better but you cant curve glass I gave it a high review because the brand is great and my wife was able to get a glass protector for her screen on her phone ,positive
This is a life saver This is my 2nd time purchasing this item I would NOT or NEVER purchase anything else except this Samsung Protector It has protected my phone from a fall from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor My phone landed on cement outside and phone DID NOT CRACK Only the protector crack Love love this screen protector ,negative
I do not own the curved S7 but the edges are still slightly curved The glass sits above the edge so there has been dirt and other little things collecting ever since Also dropped my phone day one and the glass protector cracked I know thats the point but Ive never had any type of phone protection break on me so easily ,negative
This glass protector fits the screen perfectly and is case friendly I use it with my Otterbox Commuter series case and there are no issues Clarity is excellent and it really doesnt hold smudges so its really easy to clean I have used cheaper ones on previous phones and there is definitely a positive difference with this For me was well worth the money ,positive
Best Buy price matched and glad they did Easy to put on and sensativity is nice Product breaks easy with short fall to carpet several times They get you for 10 dollars everytime you replace I have had better break quality with cheaper glasses Not worth it ,positive
Doesnt fit properly Poorly mfg Tried 6 different covers to no avail Spoke to factory todaypossibly a new version will be available by year end Or so zagg company said Best Buy was well aware of the problem but was not able to do anything about it It would be great if the manufacturing company who made the incorrect design fixed the problem sooner ,positive
The screen protector does not adhere to the left and right edges of my screen It has already broken along the edges in three places within a month It has probably protected my screen which is why I gave it 2 stars It is still under warranty so Ill either get a replacement or refund but it should work better than it has ,positive
I needed a screen protector for my S7 and this one was the best one out at the time It works fine but the only issue I have with it is that it does not completely cover the screen on the phone Theres still like a quarter of an inch of the screen still exposed Supposedly Zagg has released another screen protector that covers the entire phone now though ,positive
Ive had my own Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S6 for two years and its great When it came time to upgrade my wifes phone the clear choice was the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7These do a GREAT job protecting the screen and are very sensitive to the touchCharlie Seymour Jr ,positive
It sells itself My concern is the employees Instead of the employees talking to each its more professional to greet every customer and not turn their backs and continue their conversation Please approach the customer and not what has happened last or going to happen that day Thank you ,negative
Ive never bought a glass screen so i thought it would be neat to try this time I like it but the when applying for the first time it small air pockets kept creeping up on both sides of the phone As i pressed firmly around the edges to seal a small crack appeared For the most part I like it with an additional hard case as extra protection ,positive
Okay youre going to buy local buy a Zagg invisishield obviously because they our local company that make a good product usually With the S7 I hate to say it the edges dont sit down and you have whats called haloing youll never get a good fit youll constantly get dirt and grime and hair underneath it and you will pull it off just get the HDX ,negative
The galaxy s7 was designed with a beveled screen and this protector doesnt fit well The edges dont seal allowing dust and particles to collect around the sides Its also interferes with the touch features at the edge of the screen due to the poor design However it still does the job of protecting the screen and the company does guarantee their product ,negative
As usual Zagg doesnt disappoint I almost always go with Zagg or Spiegen This time I needed something quick and didnt want to wait for an order to come in for Spiegen so went with Zagg Instructions are clear and they include everything you need to put the screen protector on right away Its held up so far through a couple bangs Top quality here ,positive
It was easy to attach to the phone which I really liked but it doesnt stick very well in the upper corners and is coming off a little more each day I dont remember dropping my phone but there is a chip in the screen protector and not the actual phone screen so it seemed to do the job I wouldve rated it higher if it adhered to the phone better ,positive
Ive been buying ZAGG screen protectors since 2012 and this is the only time Ive been disappointedThe glass protector doesnt fit the phone correctly and cracks around the edges Originally I thought it was a one time problem and used ZAGGs lifetime warranty I got a replacement and the same cracks happened within a few days ,negative
This thing has a way better feel than other screen protectors It is glass and well feels like glass Install was a breeze Took me a couple tries to get it centered Got ta be really careful if you peel it up to re center Its glass and will break Great product for the about the same price as other protectors And a warranty ,positive
Maybe its just me but the last 2 Ive bought have broke very quickly I usually never have that problem Although it is a new phone so I suppose it could be the design of the phone But the point of the protector is to protect the actual phone screen and it definitely does that I have not had a phone screen ever crack so thats great ,negative
The glass covers the viewable area of the screen however the S7 screen curves slightly on the edges and the Zagg does not seat well as it is flat and does not match the curve of the screen The gap is easily visible and appears that you didnt smooth out the screen protector on the edge Not attractive Great product great warranty poor fitment ,positive
My son got the galaxy 7 for his birthday two weeks ago I immediately added an otter box case and a Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector because I know Well the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector already has a crack but the phone screen is completely fine Thank you Zagg for saving the screen on a brand new Galaxy 7 ,negative
Ive had a smartphone for 8 years and managed to never break the screen When I purchased my new phone six weeks ago this was the protector the sales rep suggested Given my history I almost didnt buy it Last week I dropped my phone in a parking lot and the protector shattered but NOT the screen on my phone I love this product ,negative
Had the protection on my phone and phone in a mophie case dropped it and the screen cracked but not the screen protector due to the angle of the hit the case should have protected it the protector was replaced by Zagg for about 7 which was about 12 of the sale price I paid or about 14 normal price the replacement process was easy ,positive
Im very familiar with Zagg products and so I didnt bother reading any reviews of this product BIG MISTAKE This product does not fit the Galaxy S7 It was not made to the dimensions of the screen and therefore will not protect your phone as it should It will not adhere to any of the edges and will make parts of your screen difficult to interact with ,negative
Smooth clear and a perfect fit Cant believe the sharpness of my screen I am always amazed at how great my screen looks I am a first time glass screen protector user and cant believe that for years I dealt with bubbles and marks on my film screen protectors If youve never used one before this is a must I am a firm believer of Zagg products ,positive
The Screen Protector doesnt fully seal along the edges Which creates a halo along the edges and within 4 days you notice dust inside and it starts to peel off I registered the product with Zagg and they shipped a cheaper version wasnt glass but it covered my whole screen with no problem Pretty much 40 dollars down the drain ,negative
I bought this screen protector and a day later it already had a crack in it Didnt drop my phone or anything as i didnt have a casd on it at the time and my phone had no scratches so i exchanged for a new one and once i took it out of the box i noticed it was cracked in half Wouldnt waste my money again on this screen protector or brand ,negative
Hard to review since the glass screen protector cracked like a dinged windshield unexpectedly I am not aware of dropping it or hitting it with a sharp object Whatever happened the phone itself is still sound which is the purpose of the screen protector It was expensive Thank goodness the geeks said I didnt need to worry about replacing it now ,negative
The first day of owning my Samsung Galaxy S7 it slid off the desk hitting the keyboard shelf on the way down I picked it up and my heart stopped There was what looked like chip on the edge of the screen Closer examination showed it was the screen protector that had taken the damage So glad they installed it instore at Best Buy ,positive
The Zagg Invisible Glass Screen Protector provides excellent screen protection for our cell phones Weve used them on 3 different phone styles and each style has a perfect fit Weve also had to replace a couple of the screens and had NO issues with the company The screens were replaced quickly and simply A terrific product ,positive
I have had the screen protector on my phone for a little over a month and there is already a small nick in it Hasnt been dropped at all I do sometimes have it in my purse with my wallet keys etc Itsr eally small can barely see it I noticed because I felt something rough on the screen while wiping it off Going to call about the warranty ,negative
If you are getting a new phone get one of these immediately You will regret not buying one if you drop the phone often which is inevitable Works great so far and I have dropped it several times No cracks or breaks so far Note I am also using a smaller otterbox case Both items coupled together act as a great deterrent to breaks ,negative
Bought this on recommendation of Best Buy phone seller guy It has taken a beating and has protected my new phone very well It also has fantastic rodent resistance as my guinea pig was nibbling on it and did not damage it It does have dust around the edges between the shield and the screen presumably because the screen curves slightly ,negative
I bought this screen protection for my Galaxy 7 The fit had the edges exposed and the screen would pull off the glass of the phone whenever it dragged across anything or my fingers hit the exposed edge The protector might work with certain protective cases but not with the one I use I had so many problems I returned the screen protector ,positive
Good screenight protector I like that theres a lifetime warranty on the product Ive only had it for 3 weeks and theres a small crack in the corner already even though I havent dropped my phone And sometimes its hard to type on the ends of the screen as it doesnt stick closely to the screen Overall a good purchase and Id buy it again ,negative
Zang makes a good screen protector with a lifetime warranty The only con to this would be if you put your keys or change in the same pocket as your phone If you do you will get cracks in the glass screen protector but better there than in your phone screen They are very good about sending you a new one but you do have to pay shipping ,positive
i like ZAGGs glass screen protectors i have one on my phone and it works quite well and if it everr breaks they will send you a new one my only complaint is that i have to pay 6 shipping whenever that happens and thats about the price that i could pay for a different companies glass screen protector ,positive
Zagg used to be the go to for screen protectors Same yourself the headache and the money and dont buy this tempered glass you will have a halo around the glass because it does not touch the screen The screen curves before the edge of the phone Do you research and dont listen to the sales associate Buy a film screen protector instead ,negative
Glass was to rigid The sides would not stay down I tried to return to best buy they would not deal with it because it was open Called manufacturers they did not hesitate to replace it they gave me several options on how to replace the product I have no problem dealing with the manufacturer at all they were great ,negative
I dont know how anyone could give this product better than a 1 star It just doesnt fit and Zagg acts like it is suppose to hover over the edges of the phone where dust can get underneath it or it can snag on clothing One of the poorest products I have ever seen from a normally very good company Absolutely terrible product ,negative
Bought this vs the privacy screen because I care more about a broken screen over people judging my pinterest Good product thus far it has done its job Its basically the same clarity you get from the original screen so I dont have to turn my brightness all the way up or block a glare A little pricey but saves me in the long run I guess ,negative
This is the second one of these that Ive purchased and the first one was great I had this one for all of 7 days before cracking it Thats my fault of course for dropping it but my old one lasted over a year before cracking so I was a little disappointed Comes with a warranty but Im too lazy to go through those steps ,negative
These products are well worth the money They have protected my phone on many occasions I just put a new one on my phone and within 2 days unfortunately I dropped my phone again So off to the store to get a new one These things are just amazing ,positive
I have 3 phones two of which are my kids My oldest is not what you would call gentle with her technology Every screen shes had shes managed to bust pretty much no matter what This phone is the exception because while the shield is cracked and chipped you can clearly see the device screen underneath is still intact ,positive
This item does not fit the S7 screen well at the edges even when perfectly installed A call to ZAGG revealed that they know this will not lie perfectly on the S7 surface but that they are working on an update that will fit better This begs the question of why they and Best Buy are selling it Their answer its better than nothing Boooo ,positive
I had the HD Invisible shield on my other phone for 2 years and had no issues I heard good things about the glass shield so decided to upgrade with my phone purchase Within a week there is a crack down the entire shieldI gave it 4 stars as Im not sure if this was a product defect or when it was installed by the store associate ,negative
So I did not know that while this says that it is for the S7 it does not fit correctly The screen is proportionate and everything except it tends to flex up around the edges of the screen I was later told that it is the way the S7 is designed and the plastic protectors work better than the glass ,positive
Bought this screen protector for my wife Doesnt even lay flat on the edges It also cracked during the application process Im glad that I only lost my best buy points to purchase it The only reason for the lifetime warranty is it is way overpriced to begin Buy any less expensive screen protector other than this piece of junk ,negative
This protector gets the job done but it does not go edge to edge designed for a cover My cover does not line up with the glass protector so there is an area around the phone that is not sealed and dirt gets under it The glass protector was even placed by the Best Buy employee and she used the wipe cleaner first ,negative
It does not fit on the screen properly There is a slight curve on the S7 and this screen protector lay flat on the screen leaving a raised edge of the glass protector As i tried to push it down more to make a seal the glass cracked However Zagg customer service is great Just do not waste your time with this specific model ,negative
I had a member of the Geek Squad apply this for me the day I upgraded to a Galaxy S7 and she did an amazing job The glass itself makes your finger feel like its swiping air and honestly feels smoother than the screen on some of my unprotected devices even an iPad And you cant beat the warranty on it A good investment to be sure ,positive
I have a black iPhone 6 The edges do not stick to the phone It is very frustrating and the only reason I kept it is I got such a good deal on it I would not recommend this Even the employee said after she had applied it that this shield typically doesnt work with the black iPhone 6 Thanks for the heads up after applying it ,positive
I am pretty active and drop my phone at times Nice to know that I can get something to help insure that when I do drop my phone that it will be protected to some degree These things are not cheap so I feel it is acting responsible to protect an investment ,positive
It does protect the screen however it does not fit properly around the edgesI had mine installed at Best Buy and within one week the edges have cracks I dont drop my phone or abuse it at all so that should not have happened It is a new phone model and they still have some work to do in getting the proper screen protector for it ,positive
I was skeptical of purchasing a glass cover the sales folks talked me into the added benefits of it and I have to say I love it Like the way it is easier to do the swipe function with it easier to keep clean and overall nicer appearance And greater protections I would recommend this as an option over the other screen protectors ,positive
I guess the way the S7 is shaped doesnt allow the the screen cover to lay flat not terrible unless youre a little neurotic Debris can get stuck to the perimeter but it is what it is I guess So far I have dropped my phone a couple time and the screen has remained in tact despite the body of the phone cracking under the case ,negative
I was not sold on getting a glass cover but was convinced of the value by the sales person She showed me her phone and how it looked and the value for protection I must say I am now a fan It is easier to use the swipe function and the phone screen is more readable with the glass cover Appreciate the advice from staff member ,positive
It protects my screen okay but you have to live with cracks and nicks It is easy to cause damage I am a person who has never cracked my screen so seeing dents and cracks on my protector screen was scary I am going with another brand even though it has a warranty I dont want to go thru the hassle over and over again ,negative
I purchased this and the install from my local best buy store A couple of days and there were already hairline fractures in the screen protector and the edges are bubbling up Ive not even dropped the phone or been hard on it Im not sure if the product is defective or if it was placed on incorrectly but its very frustrating ,negative
Zagg really stands behind their products and I would never consider any other screen protector They offer a lifetime warranty you can replace it as many times as you need to with and with Powerhouse like the Samsung S7 you need this to protect the screen Perfect reliability this is a musthave ,positive
This is a high quality item Comes with all you need to install easily and you can feel the thickness and quality vs other competitive products It is more expensive than others but in this case the quality does support the extra costsso it is a good value considering it will last twice as long as most other protectors ,positive
Several reviews commented that the screen easily cracked Well mine arrived from Best Buy SHATTERED When I called customer service and explained this the man paused and then said So you are saying it is damaged I couldnt deal Will be returning to a local store Absolutely disappointed with my entire experience ,negative
I purchased this screen protector with a new phone and it was installed by Best Buy Mobile After installation I noticed it did not adhere to the edges of the screen glass Due to a slight curvature on the outer edges the screen on the Galaxy S7 the protector would not seat and could easily be removed I took this protector back ,negative
Clearest screen protector Ive had no scuffs so far and crystal clear Little on the pricey side but if it holds up in the long run well worth it Now if only Otter Box would come with these I wouldnt have had to punch out the junky plastic screen cover and replace it with this ,negative
I have the regular Galaxy S7 and this screen protector does not contour to the the shape of the screen The edges of this screen have a slight curve to them not as much as the edge but enough so that the edges of the screen protector do not lay flat I have owned a Galaxy S5 with the glass Zagg protector and didnt have this problem ,negative
The glass screen protector does not curve to fit the screen of the samsung galaxy s7 and therefore the glass sticks up and collects dust and dirt underneath it Its a shame because I really like zaggs shields and they work really really well when they actually fit the intended product in the right way ,positive
TamiJosh and Carlos are fantastic to work with beforeduring and after the sale Carlos has helped us many times at the Samsung counter with other Samsung products They are the reason we switched to Best Buy and Verizon from another carrier for two new phones and a tablet Its like being with family as they are so friendly ,positive
New Galaxy S8 phone requires a new Zagg glass screen protector I dont use any other type and have never had a phone screen shatter although I have been through quite a few Zagg protectors I drop my phone a lot I would have given it 5 stars but the S8 is not as touch sensitive with this new protector on ,negative
I let the sales person talk me into my first glass cover for the Galaxy S7 Put it on and immediately noticed it has about a quarter inch around the edge of the screen that the protector does not lay flat against Even worse it interferes with touch screen operation around edges Not happy at all Best Buy better give me a refund ,positive
Cracked the screen within 6 days of getting phone I was originally told there was a lifetime warranty but was never told I needed to contact manufacturer for product then bring that into the store to be installed Im going on my thirst screen in less then 1 month I guess it does its job since my phone screen isnt broken ,negative
This wasnt my first time buying these screen protectors but this time I was not too impressed As I was applying the screen protector it cracked on the bottom just as I applied it But otherwise it does do its job I have not had a cracked screen at all just the protector has taken the scratches and cracks ,negative
All zagg glass screens are awesome Only problem is that new phones are all curving the edges of the screens at the edge When applying this protector to the s7 it leaves a halo around the edge where the protector doesnt touch the screen This area then collects dust and makes the outter most edge of my phone unusable ,negative
Happy with the protection it provides and the life time replacement warranty Although you have to get it from Zagg Best Buy will install the replacement for free if you paid for installation when you purchased it Hate the beveled edges although it looks cool it can make it more difficult to type on the keys near the edges ,positive
I encouraged my wife to install this on her new phone because she is notorious for damaging phones 3 days after installing the shield she dropped her phone and shattered this protector I feel this saved her screen from shattering I have always used Invisible Shield products and loved them all Worth every penny ,negative
Applied the screen protector on the phones screen as directed in instructions Bubble appeared and couldnt smooth it out A week later my phone dropped on the ground one time and screen protector cracked immediately Under warranty I went to website to get a replacement and had to pay for shipping and handling for new one ,negative
This Zagg screen protector seems to do its job of protecting the phones screen but it is not very resilient at all Within 2 weeks there are 2 separate areas that have already cracked I will be making a claim against the lifetime warranty so after that I may add a star or deduct another depending on how that goes ,negative
I bought this to replace the one on my phone that shattered Protected the phone However learned the hard way after installation that warranty replacement must be done through the company website So I lost money on this one not BBs fault ,negative
Ive used Zagg covers on my phones for several years They are constantly upgrading and improving their productsThe nice thing about the glass shield is that it has a much nicer feel to the touch Many screen protectors dont give the same touch sensation as the actual screen These feel like the screen I like that ,positive
Ive been through two InvisibleShield Glass protectors for the Galaxy S7 The shield does not adhere to the entire screen Along both sides of the screen there is a 18 gap where the shield remains off of the screen Within a week the shield cracks along this gap ,negative
The product was not designed properly for the Galaxy S7 The installer tried three different covers and they all did the same thing and that was for my phone He also tried twice on my husbands and got the same result Ive dropped my phone twice by accident and now my screen is shattered in three places ,positive
This cell phone shield for the screen is subpar in that it does not go completely to the edge and secure there is an air gap all around the face of the screen so it isnt completely sealedit can still do the job as long as the center holds its placebut it is better than nothing ,positive
It did not fit my Galaxy S7 and dust was collecting on the areas that did not fitwhen I took my phone back due to other problems with the phone I asked about the size and fitofthe screen and I was told he didnt know why it didnt fit and replaced it with a different HD screen that fit betterwaste of money ,negative
Im a firm believer in Zagg products Ive been using them for years This particular product is not well designed Its not curved and makes it hard to use the edges on the touchscreen Its a shame Best Buy even sells this product I hope I can return this product Ill order from Zagg directly the next time ,negative
I just bought my new phone and screen protector a month ago Only after 3 weeks I noticed the side of my protector screen had a chip in it There was no trauma done to the screen or phone to cause this so Im not sure what caused it to happen Ive never had an issue with Zagg so Im bummed this one broke so quick ,negative
Purchased this after recommendation from a Best Buy employee when returning the HD plastic Invisible Shield I feel that my screen is more secure with the glass version versus the plastic The only drawback is that it leaves a line going down both sides of the protector that looks like a line of dirt that cant be cleaned ,positive
When I had an iPhone I always purchased the Zagg glass for screen protection Tried to do the same when I switched to Samsung Discovered that at least with the S7 the edges of the phone makes it difficult to apply the glass Resulting look is an air bubble that circles the entire phone hence the nickname halo ,negative
I am really disappointed My glass has 2 cracks The 1st one occurred with a slight hit of a TV remote The 2nd crack no where near the 1st just suddenly appeared My phone has not been dropped or mishandled If anything buy the invisible shield I have never cracked the glass on any phone I have ever owned ,negative
I LOVE Zagg shields However the BB associate who put on mine left air leaks on the side Where the air bubbles are it has cracked already after limited use I registered my shield so Ill only have to pay shipping for another but its still a little frustrating Make sure the shield is put on properly ,negative
This ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 did not fit the S7 It doesnt curve at the edges and cracked the day after I installed the protector I would give it a 0 Do not waste your money on this item I called Zagg and they recommended S7 users install the acrylic protector ,negative
This product works perfectly I had it for about 2 days dropped my phone the glass cracked but the phone was fine I sent it in for replacement with 6 shipping they sent a new one and that lasted 4 days before the same thing happenedphone still fine They will keep shipping new ones for 6 foreverperfect ,positive
Bought this screen saver for my mothers phone she loves it Only issue she had wit was that it wasnt put on correctly and started peeling When she had it in her pocket it peeled and cracked when she sat down She had no issues getting it replaced They send out new one wa return envelope to make it quick and easy ,negative
I researched a lot before choosing this screen protector It had to be the best for my phone Why protect it with anything less I love that this has a lifetime warranty My screen protector has cracked due to my boyfriend mishandling it and I was able to just request another one all I had to pay for was the shipping ,positive
Tempered glass is not cheap but worth to buy It is easy to clean durable and doesnt easily leave finger marks compared to cheap ones I also saw reviews online and people are saying manufacturer are true to their words on warranty If you break it manufacturer will replace it ,positive
I had this put on at the store and the technician did the best he could But the edges of the screen must curve and there is 18 around all edges that is not stuck down I carry my phone in my pocket and there is already lint and dirt under the edges and I have only had it a week ,negative
I bought this for my galaxy s7 Fit is very good and it is wider than other screen protector glass However the edge of protector is weakI think I have little cracking even if I did not have any big drop of my phone Anyway this warranty I believe will be good so they will provide good service ,positive
Doesnt even feel like you have a screen protector installed it is so smooth Ive tried installing these myself and theres nothing worse than trapping lint or an air bubble under that shiny new protector I recommend Geek Squad installation to insure you walk out with a perfectly clean clear screen ,positive
Love my Zagg tempered class screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S7 It looks just like the screen without a protector Really works well I somehow got a chip on the upper corner of the first one I purchased but my phone screen was undamaged I had to replace the broken one Love the way it looks ,positive
Within the first 24 hours I dropped my phone 1 time and in that one time the glass cover got a scratch in it The one I had on my old phone took a beating and barely had a crack in it I am slightly bummed that this one hasnt handled as well It still did its job just bummed it happened in the 24 hour period ,negative
Arrived as described Actual glass was too big for the Galaxy S7 Where the edges bevel on the phone the glass shield stayed raised since it would have to bend to adhere with the phone curves so it never makes a complete seal This caused the glass shield to crack with no virtually no pressure applied ,negative
Zagg non glass screen protectors are great however the glass ones are the worst My phone dropped a short distance ON ITS BACK and the screen protector shattered after only having it a few days My husbands also randomly cracked in his pocket within the first 2 weeks The absolute worst protectors ever ,negative
I was hoping the prior reviews may have just gotten lemons but sadly no the edges never stay down and it will soon become an issue as dust settlesedges raise Save yourself the hassle and use a different model The brand itself however is good which is why I gave it 2 stars prior experience was awesome ,negative
Im sure this type of screen protector works quite well with many phones however due to the S7 having a slightly curved screen it cracks all along the sides and leaves an unsightly halo down both sides as well This protector should not have been marketed for this phone ,positive
First smartphone which I researched over 3 months So happy with it and especially the quality of the camera and battery lifetime Am excited to learn more about the phone after taking a Samsung Workshop from Best Buy which will maximize opportunities for me Cant go wrong worth every penny of the investment ,positive
Works as described It keeps your screen cleaner than the otter box screen but it breaks easy And the replacement warranty is a joke I contacted zagg about replacing my last one It costs 7 to get it with the warranty Really the warranty just says we will sell you another screen protector ,negative
Had BB put one of these on my wifes S7 Works great and is very clear She throws her phone in her purse with about 8 million pounds of other things and so far this has kept the screen from picking up any scratches Tends to smear a little bit with fingerprints andor cosmetics but that is to be expected ,negative
The screen protector worked well though it was a little difficult to get all of the spots out Ive put protectors on many times and this was not the easiest one to use however I would buy it again in the future ,positive
I purchase from Best Buy because the product that they sell the brandsthey make available are the Best Quality the Geek squad technical support and warranties are excellent the personal is knowledgeable helpful and courteous Prices are either competitive or betterBuy Best BuyBestHenry Young ,positive
I paid around 18 for this product put it on my phone as instructed only to be left with these air filled lines at the edges of my phone I applied as much as force as possible to get the air out without any success Took it off and retried only to collect dust and hair on it Waste of money ,negative
I dont like that it only comes with one cover you get one good shot at applying It can be done again not as smooth Comes with great kit to do it though wet cloth and dry cloth to clean first and good steps Havent had it really put to the test for protection yet so far so good ,positive
This was bought for my Samsung Galaxy S7 When applying it I almost had it perfect with no flaws but could not get rid of an annoying bubble in middle of screen Reapplying it caused more screen imperfection issues that were impossible to get rid of I am not using it on my phone as a result ,negative
This screen protector is very clear and not detectable except for the fact that mine has a crack in it Perhaps the protector did its job by protecting the phones screen but it cracked right away after a very gentle bump simply putting the phone down on a table not tossing it or dropping it ,negative
The Zagg glass protector is flat and the Galaxy S7 has curved edges If this sits in a tough case it may be fine If you have a rubber case and tend to put the phone in your pocket the edge will crack Sure it comes with a warranty how useful is it when it will not last two weeks ,positive
This does not fit the S7 properly and leaves what Zagg calls a halo effect around the screen where it will not stick I contacted Zagg customer care and was told they are working on a curved one to fit the phone correctly but customers need to register and pay a 10 upgrade fee Not cool Zagg ,positive
either make the protector smaller or find a way to have it work better the the curvature of the screen around the edges I ended up only having it on my phone for a few weeks before too much gunk got under the edges I pulled it back to try to clean the edges and it cracked in the bottom half Would not recommend ,positive
This is a great screen protector but I did break one within 2 weeks after using it ZAGG was great about replacing it but it did cost 599 for shipping So dont knock your phone off of the counter or drop it very often because you will be requesting a new screen proctor often and the shopping costs will add up ,negative
This screen protector is so much easier to install than the adhesive plastics I will go with a glass cover from now on The downside is that it can still get damaged which happened pretty quickly for me but only on one edge so Im still using it and havent submitted for a replacement under warranty yet ,negative
This is the first time I have used a screen protector Installation was done in store by the Samsung rep It was done before I realized he had even started Invisible and functional After reading the information with the product I am sure I could have easily installed it myself Great Service ,negative
The associate applied the screen protector for me when I purchased my phone When she was done she said that there would be a halo effect around the edges but it would go away in a couple of days It never went away and now it is cracked on the edge On a good note the screen underneath is not cracked ,negative
This is my second screen The first one I had to returned it Didnt last long and my second one its already broken They have a lifetime guarantee but you have to paid shipping and handling and if I continued doing the returning of the product I will be ending paying more than the actual price ,negative
My Review its a good screen protector i had one for my old phone and i dropped my phone and the screen shattered i thought but it was only the screen protector and as i peeled it off my phone screen was fine Only complaint i have is it does not fit the complete phone as my old one did ,negative
If I could give this product no stars I would The screen didnt even completely adhere time the s7 screen Then After a week the corners of at the top of the screen began to Crack and flake offor and cut my ear Soo Thank you zagg Im normally impressed with your product search but not this one ,positive
Cracked easily I was able to get a free replacement I ordered online paying only for shipping It arrived in a timely manner Returned cracked one in their postage paid envelope I recently noticed a chip in the new shield Im not sure if I want to pay for shipping again Next time Ill go back to plastic ,positive
I really like this product I have bought for 4 phones so far You have to pay to get Best Buy to install the first time then they will install any replacements for you for free Zagg stands by their product and I will continue to purchase for future phones I get A must have ,positive
I have always used the other material to protect the display I tried this one because it was recommended The phone slipped out of my wore out holder I had attached to my belt and cracked within the first week Not a good choice if your phone ever falls out of your hand or case ,positive
I bought one for my phone and one for the wifes phone I broke mine I dont know how so I need to go get it replaced Better to break the protector than the screen Still able to use the phone just fine I did think that this would be a bit more durable but I am satisfied with its performance ,positive
I used to have the plastic shield and had no problems with it peeling or scratches I was given the recommendation to try the glass and I do not like it because of how easily it cracks and scratches My screen on my phone is completely undamaged however after 15 years ,negative
I was expecting these glass shields to be much more scratch and crack resistant Scratches much easier than the regular phone screen and cracks much easier too My daughters screen protector was completely cracked within two weeks Glad they have a good warranty But who knows how long the replacement will last ,negative
Ive never been impressed since they started making glass screen protectors that dont cover the edges Within one month of purchasing this there were 4 chips on the edges and a crack starting from one of them I requested a warranty replacement and got the original shield that goes to the edges ,negative
So far seems to protect my scree from dirt and scratches However the edges have still not molded to the screen so there is a bit of a halo effect around the edge Not too big a deal but a bit annoying Been about a month feels like it shouldnt take this long But the screen is protected so Ill put up with it ,negative
Of all the screen protectors I have applied this is absolutely the easiest It literally took just minutes There were initially 2 large bubbles which smoothed right out with very little effort I will be shocked if it ever comes loose around the edges Great product ,negative
I was very surprised by the way it crumbled around the edges so fast I only had it on my phone a couple of months I am very careful when handling my phone Ithe was easy to install I have to get another screen protector dont know if I m going to get the same one Mixed feelings right now ,positive
I usually have a Otterbox on my phone and was talked into trying this product While it is nice that it you cant see it or even feel that its there I already have two cracks in it It does have a lifetime guarantee which Ive already sent off for but Ive only had it 3 weeks Very disappointed ,negative
The screen protector does not cover the whole screen which would be fine if it didnt hang over the slightly curved edges of the Galaxy S7I dont have the S7 Edge The edges became less and less responsive to touch then unusable There are plenty of Glass screen protectors that are similar for under 10 ,negative
On a Galaxy S7 this screen would not seal at the edges about 14 of an inch was raised up and would not stick I had it installed by the Geek Squad guys initially Returned it and they replaced and reinstalled but still had the same problem I exchanged for the plastic version and it worked better for me ,positive
The application of the screen protector is great The more fragile areas are the locations near the speakers and front cameras I wish the glass was a little thicker in these spots My protector broke in these two locations after a week I work in the Automotive repair field ,negative
I like the screen shield overall It was easy to install with the guide tabs My screen responds well through the shield I didnt give 5 stars because there is a distinct line on both sides of the shield that doesnt adhere to my screen I do have a case so the shield isnt peeling off ,positive
I love the Zagg brand and their warrantyI never had a problemeasy to get a new one This is the first time I bought a glass one vs a membrane one There is a halo around the edge of mine and mine cracked within the week Unsure if I am just hard on my phones but my phone was totally protected ,negative
Do not buy This screen protector does not fit The halo effect they describe is in fact the screen protector not appropriately fitting the s7 This screen protector is flat The s7s screen had curved edges The halo is where the screen protector doesnt adhere to the screen ,negative
This is a horrible product I wish the sales clerk would have known that this Glass protector would have broken because of the tapered edge of the glass on my S7 they should not sell this product The old plastic screen protector is the way to go on anything with a beveled peace of glass ,negative
I dropped my phone while outside and of course it completely missed the yard and landed on the driveway Thank goodness the shield did its job and protected the phone Quick replacement of the shield and all is well ,positive
I have purchased multiple Zagg protectors in the past and all have been excellent Their customer service is second to none One of my phones was stolen and after I gave them proof of purchase they sent me another glass free of charge Only paid shipping Cant ask for more than that ,positive
Flat glass that doesnt fit the rounded edge S7 geek squad knows they dont fit but still offer it just to have them returned It leaves about a 14 of both sides of screen not stuck downI returned it and had to go to another store to buy a soft screen protector because BB was sold out ,negative
I love this produce I had one on an older phone and I dropped it and the screen protector shattered It was time to upgrade so took it and they would only take it as a trade in if the screen wasnt broken We took off the protector and the phones scene was unharmed Will always use this product ,negative
I bought this based on the recommendation of the Best Buy associate It seems fine and its worked without any issues My biggest complaint is it seems a little small for the Samsung S7 There is a small gap between the edge of the protective screen and the edge of the phones screen ,positive
the screen protector does not curve at the edges and overhangs The screen protector is brittle and breaks easily at those edges the phone fell on my bed then to the carpet and broke at the edge where it overhangs on the first day dont waste your money on this product find one that curves at the edge ,negative
Ive had good luck with Zagg products in the past this screen protector is no exception I have a problem with the edges of the screen protector cracking this isnt a knock on the product I think the case Im using is causing the problem Otherwise the protector does what its supposed to do ,negative
Dont do what I didRead reviews mainly negative and still purchaseAs stated by others the sides lift causing the glass to separate and chip Took less than a month for this product to become inferior and returned for a full refundI recommend the Lifeproof Fre case for the Samsung Galaxy G7 ,negative
I hate having air bubbles or scratches on my screen protectors and this has solved my problem It is well worth the cost Also the best buy rep put the screen protector on for me so I did not stress too much about dust or air bubbles between the screen and the protector Thank you so much ,negative
I bought this for my new phone Zagg glass works as advertised When I had it on my old phone and the glass cracked I was able to get a new one from Zagg The process was easy and even easier to put it on my phone myself This definitely protects your phone screen and is worth every single dollar ,positive
This screen protector chips way too easily Several days after having it installed on my phone it cracked on the edge without any apparent cause It looks like a small preexisting edge defect allowed the glass to chip next to the power button After several more days a crack formed and grew ,negative
Does not adhere to the curved edges allowing dirt dust and hair to get stuck to the exposed section Zagg calls it full coverage and claims that it is by design But then explained they are currently working on a redesig Not sure how its getting 35 stars over all with all these bad reviews ,negative
good clear protect except does not stick to the edge of the screen creating a halo edge effect this impacts the touch screen sensitivity as you must press harder in that area to make it work Installed at Best Buy who promised to notify me when a fix is available still waiting several months ,positive
I love the products but not this version Day one the glass cracked and webbed Day 3 or the second one and it shattered and webbed Im ocd about protecting my phones and this was with general use and button push home screen area on gs7 Avoid this get the regular plasticoriginal screen protector ,negative
This is 2nd Zagg shield for this phone The 1st one suffered a crack after falling from roof of house onto a rock pile I thought phone would be destroyed but thanks to Zagg and a dollar store case the phone and screen were fine Thanks Zagg ,negative
Disappointed that this screen broke in less than 24 hrs I didnt drop my phone or drop anything on it Just looked over and the screen was cracked Happy that Zagg replaces the screen for free minus shipping and handling but I shouldnt have had to use this free pass so soon or without reason ,negative
We dropped my phone on rocks in Maui taking a selfie and it looked like the screen was shattered but it was only the zagg protector that was shattered and they mailed me a new one for only a few dollars in shipping costs ,positive
To start I will say the screen protector is easy to install but the glass does not completely adhere to the phone leaving an air gap the whole way around the phone allowing dust to easily make its way under the edges For the price of this thing the edges should be flawless ,positive
waited a couple months until zagg fixed their measuring errors for the samsung galaxy s7 screen protector but i think i still bought an old version if they even fixed the error i never attached the screen but holding it to my phone it still looked small and for the price wouldnt risk it ,negative
dont waste your money on this screen saver i purchased new when i bought new phone dropped it one time and shattered along the edge wife bought the same thing and the exact same thing happened with hers we will be going back to the old nonglass style screen saver in the future ,positive
Do not buy this for your phone if you expect it to fit your phone from edge to edge Even though it is for a S7 and not a S7 edge the phones screen is still a little curved and it will not lay flat on the edges of the screen It also will collect lint dirt etc along the edges ,negative
This glass shield for the Samsung S7 has known problems halo around edges does not seal but I decided to get because I figured some protection is better than none I have gotten several replacements from Zagg through their lifetime warranty 599 shipping which theyre good about ,positive
The glass screen does not follow the contour around the edges of the Galaxy S7 The phone has a downward slope and the glass does not bend Hence there is a noticeable edge around the entire edgeI gave it a two because Zagg customer service was great and provided me a non glass replacement ,positive
screen protection is great doesnt seem to scratch 3 stars do to the edges of the protector do not contour to the phone screen After having the phone in my pocket for a few weeks there is a noticeable amount of lint between the screen and the protector at the edges ,positive
I bought this when recommended by the Best Buy guy So far its been good I have dropped my phone a few times with no problems Its only been a month so I am not sure if It will actually prevent my phone from cracking but so ive dropped my phone and neither the shield or the screen have cracked ,negative
This screen protector does not fit all the way to the sides Evidently the s7 is slightly beveled on the edges Im sure the next generation will be better At the time of purchase it was all that was available It does the job but Id like better fit and finish not that Id sacrifice function ,positive
Im super clumsy when it comes to my phone Ive dropped the thing way to many times but this product saves my screen every time Whats even better is that it has a great warranty so when I inevitably crack the screen protector Ill be able to get another Well worth the price ,positive
One of the worst protectors Ive had to replace twice already it cracks on its own I went from having iPhone to galaxy purchase same product before in the past which I had great experience with but on this phone the product isnt durable doesnt last not even a month dont waste your money ,negative
I got this for my wifes phone and it saved her screen when it fell off her lap while she was sitting in the car and it landed screen first on the driveway The screen protector shattered but her phone was completely undamaged I bought this one to replace her first one ,negative
I really like the glass screen I got for my my new Samsung S7 it is very clear no bubbles on the screen I did get one scratch on it already but I am also very hard on my phone and I dropped them a lot so I wouldnt say it was a bad product had I not had one on my screen would have been cracked ,negative
ZAGG Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Bought this item when I bought my phone walked out of best buy and dropped my phone while getting in my truck hit ground and the shield cracked Ill never waist my money again on this ,negative
The edges of the glass do not meet the screen functions just fine but the official stance from zagg as of now is It works as intended if you dont want the halo get a different shield I have seen the press release in store my self This is nonsense ,positive
You definitely need this to protect your screen In less than one month I needed a new protector Fortunately I had this otherwise the screen wouldve been cracked in several places The rep was also helpful in getting this shipped out quickly and the best buy folks put it on the phone ,positive
This protector never adhered properly There was about 18 around the entire screen that just didnt stick Slowly more seems to be peeling up Its also already cracked in 4 places without being dropped or hit Im usually satisfied with Zagg protectors but not this one ,positive
The edges dont stick On the second day it cracked I took it back and they couldnt replace it because I have to go through Zapp and pay for shipping to get a new one its been one month since Ive had it and a have multiple cracks and I have not dropped my phone once Its just super sensitive ,negative
I have had two of these screen protectors in the last 2weeks and my new one was for the Samsung galaxy s7 and it doesnt appear to fit there is a halo around the whole screen Best buy was amazing for fixing the first one hoping the company fixes this in the future ,positive
Although you cant see it you know that it is there and it is protecting your investment your phone Since I put my phone directly in my purse and who knows what is it there I know that there will not be any scratches on the phones glass when I pull it out of my purse I would recommend ,negative
I have to put a screen protector on my phone for my own piece of mind This one however doesnt lay perfectly flat because if the tiny curve to the screen It has been ok but you can see a little outline area around the outside that isnt laying perfectly flat ,positive
This screen protector has protected my screen pretty well I had one on my last phone that kept it protected the whole two years The only complaint I would have is that the screen protector looks scratched or cracked and it almost looks like my phones screen is really cracked but its not ,negative
The Zagg Shield has saved the cell phone several times when it fell great product They also have a great customer svc dept I had a zagg on a previous phone that was about 4 yrs old and it started getting bubbles and dirt under it they replaced it with no issues Very easy process ,negative
My Wife bought one for her iPhone and it fit great so I bought one for my Galaxy S7 it didnt fit well at all The edges wouldnt stay down nothing we did would keep the edges down Waste of money now I have to find one that will actually work on the S7 ,positive
Because of the halo edges that are around the perimeter the screen covers cracks easily I never had this happen before but I have put two new screen protectors on and both have cracked within a day or two Not recommended ,negative
Cracks too easy and my girlfriend dropped her phone and the protector cracked and allowed the screen on phone to get scratched itself I have dropped my phone many times with a different style and it hasnt even tried cracking ,negative
Either BestBuy associates are putting the screen protector on incorrectly or this is simply a bad choice for the Samsung s7 1st time it cracked around the edges on day 3 Ordered a free replacement from Zagg Brought it to Best Buy to put on cracked around the edges again on day 2 ,negative
This cover is to protect your phone screen and it did that but in just a short time not even two weeks noticed a slight nick in it Had one before this for two years and never had one problem with it It was for an Iphone not a Samsung so not sure if that is the difference or what ,negative
Not sure if it protects the screen from impact because I havent dropped it It does seem to be chipped on an edge I noticed a white spot when it was installed at Best Buy now it seems to chip away Lifetime guarantee but zagg wants about 13 of the price I paid for the exchange ,positive
I paid 3999 for this screen protector at the advice of Best Buy staff I did not drop my phone or even bump it but the glass protector is already cracked after just 24 hours I had the cheap plastic one on my other phone and it never had anything go wrong in 2 years DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ,negative
Because the 7 curves a little the glass shield does not sit flush on the edges Within a few days it already cracked My boyfriend got the same one and his lasted about 2 weeks before it cracked Now we have to go thru warranty to get another one Looking for a different protector ,negative
Disappointed in the durability of this screen shield Have only had for a couple of months and shield is already cracked in a couple places Will go with a plastic shield as a replacement when this shield is no longer tolerable Much cheaper alternative with better longterm protection ,positive
This shield is absolutely great It keeps my phone safe from cracks when dropped and the screen is now so crystal clear to view Even my fingerprints dont show on the phone Wish I had gotten one sooner Makes a great Christmas gift for family and friends ,positive
I always prefer the glass for screen protectors but this glass is NOT shaped exactly the same as the phone which leaves a halo on both sides where the screen protector doesnt actually touch the screen I may end up removing the glass and switching to a plastic screen protector ,positive
This brand is always awesome But on this phone The HD glass cover does not work well Since the edges are slightly rounded there is a halo effect when the class is on there meaning the edges around the whole screen protector slightly lift off of the glass ,positive
Love how this feels when swiping and also protecting HOWEVER this will not fully seal around the edges of glass I took it back to Best Buy and asked the Geek Squad and they said it never will Seems that it should seal that last 116 Will find out how much dirt gets around it ,negative
Bought and had best buy install in store While the associate was installing cover he warned me of the cover not fitting properly the screen has a slight curve at the edge while the protector does not Have had for 3 days and have cracks al through out edges do not buy ,negative
this cover allowed for no damage after i dropped my phone on the pavement in 20 degree weather so it did its jobhoweveri find that the touch screen and texting require a lot more pressure than my old plastic screen cover it works but it kind of deadens the touch response ,negative
Ive used invisibleshield on just about every phone Ive had since 2010 This particular one is very difficult to install correctly and the install wipe is terrible Ended up buying the original style invisibleshield which was much easier to install and has served me well so far ,positive
This was highly recommended as THE screen protector to get for my Galaxy S7 and I agree No problems whatsoever using my phone It also gives me peace of mind that it will Crack instead of my screen Was told it has free lifetime replacements If true then well worth the money ,positive
The glass shield gives me an extra sense of protection I have dropped the phone since I purchased it and thankfully it did not chip or break I would like to think the glass shield prevented any damage to the phone I hope not to drop it again to prove my theory wrong Smile ,negative
I had the gadget geeks at best buy put this screen on for me Im not sure if I got a defective one from the beginning but it brokecracked within the first few days and I had not dropped it or anything I went back in to best buy and they did refund my money for the purchase ,positive
The protector applied easily without air bubbles The problem I have with the Galaxy S7 is near the screen edges it has a slight curve which doesnt allow the protector to adhere right up to its edges Time will tell if this will present to be an issue ,negative
Husband eyes are sensitive to light so he wears polarized sunglasses which this glass shield leaves lines throughout the screen but if you hold it sideways its fine We will have to return this due to this reason other wise it might work for others without these type of glasses ,positive
DO NOT BUY I only purchase Zagg Glass for my phones This product is poorly designed for the S7 The edges of the Glass do not seal The S7 has a slight contour that does not allow the Glass to seal properly Very disappointed with Zagg ,negative
This is the best screen protector Ive ever owned Its a little on the pricey side but protector doesnt diminish the phones resolution quality and protects your screen from impacts Ive dropped my phone several times on the face No cracks on the protector or scratches ,negative
I didnt know or wad told when i bought this product that the edges do not seal properly due to a curve on the phones screen When the tech put it on my phone he broke one Within two weeks of the second one it also got a chip in it The glass screen for my s5 never broke once ,negative
Best protector out there May be a little more money then others but well worth the If you register screen and something happens to it they will send you a new one Great product for 5 different phones for me personally ,positive
At first use the screen protector is made of good material and went on smoothly At first I thought I got the wrong one but once I talked to a clerk found out that they are not made of the curve of the screen on the edges So just a tad of material sticks out beyond the screen ,positive
Great screen protector It is durable very transparent You cant even tell it is there yet you are getting the protection from costly screen damage repair It does not interfere with the touch screen use I recommend this for protection peace of mind ,positive
very good shield bought two of these when getting my phones my son tried to adjust his glass screen protector and ended up breaking the screen protector we contacted the company and within a week we had a new screen protector with no hassles from the company Im impressed with them ,negative
Protects cell phone screen just as described I dropped my phone hit pavement protective shield cracked hairline crack removed it from phone my phone screen was intact Sent it back to manufacturer and they sent me back a replacement shield honoring their lifetime warranty ,negative
Ive gone through two of these It doesnt adhere to the edges of the screen so it cracks and you cant use the edges of the touch screen like the period button on the keyboard So now Im out the purchase price as well as the 599 for warranty replacement shipping Terrible product ,positive
The sales guy at best buy said that the way this is made that the edges arent down This seemed odd and this week I found out that it is odd The glass screen chipped There is a lifetime warranty but you have to pay for shipping I hope the one I receive sits better on the screen ,negative
The only thing that makes this screen protector any better than the cheaper ones is that you can get a replacement if you register it for the lifetime warranty Other than that go with the cheaper one It protected my screen but its already cracked in less than 2 months ,positive
I have a Galaxy S7 and the edges are showing shadows I talk to Best Buy about it and they said there is a specific protector for the Galaxy S7 but they do not carry it Talked to Zagg and they said there is not a specific protector for the S7 and that this was a known issue ,negative
These screen savers have saved my cell phone many times from having to replace the screen every time I drop it Instead just replace the screen saver the glass screen underneath is in perfect shape It is the first accessory I buy when getting a new phone ,positive
My wife was changing phone cases and dropped her phone With this on her phone she has a crack from the dropping I doesnt work and I had to have mine replaced What a run around Two trips to the store had to contact vendor pay for shipping for replacement ,negative
The protection factor is great on this thing the attractiveness isnt Upon applying it to my phone then putting on the case parts of it bubbled up and makes the appearance less attractive Its not the worst thing in the world but I wasnt thrilled about this small dilemma ,positive
Bought my first Invisibleshield Glass Screen protector So far I love the glass shield because unlike the plastic screen protectors that you can scratch and gouge the plastic on the screen protectorI have had it on my phone for a month and no indication of gouging ,negative
I think with technology advancing the way it is the term Cell Phone needs to be further extended to include all the features of these handheld giantsPerhaps a name the widget campaign to rename the device to all persons to all persons who own one may promote a true identity ,negative
For the Samsung S7 this brand of screen protectors are horrible All of them come up around the edges due to the phone having a very slight curvature Its just a waste of money Ive found better screen protectors by other brands that are the same price and dont come up ,negative
Bought this it torecracked the first day I got it I should have taken it back immediately but I went through the guarantee process which cost another 6 for shipping Have now read other reviews warning this cover doesnt fit well and I can confirm the same Dont bother ,negative
It protects my screen well enough but it doesnt cover the sides as well as I thought it would since the s7 is slightly curved No real problems installing it and fits well minus the problem I mentioned before ,positive
This screen protector was easy to apply but it did not fit very well It never sealed very good around the edges of the screen I will probably try another brand when this one starts to come loose as it certainly looks like that will happen in the very near future ,positive
I had bought this noticed product before and it started to crack on the side thought it was the glass of the phone but it was the shield Better the shield than the phone so I bought an other on and installed it within minutes Works and looks great ,negative
New S7 Protector started to deteriorate within days of putting it on I went back to BB and was told they had numerous complaints Apparently the phone is curved in such a way that it rejects the protector I was told Zagg would be coming out with a protector compatible with the S7 ,negative
The concept is a good idea however it chipped and cracked the first day just being in my pocket with my keys and some change To replace I have to deal directly with Zagg and then take it to Best Buy for installation Both are fully covered but a real pain to make work ,negative
The product works as advertised I have not broken a screen since I started using these 3 or 4 phones ago I now upgrade my phone because I want to instead of having too because of a broken screen ,negative
I gave the screen protector 4 stars because it chips kind of easy when the phone is dropped Unfortunately I have dropped it a couple of times but it did help protect the screen which is the purpose I still like the product and will buy it again when I upgrade later on ,positive
I have the same screen for my phone and it has been great for two years So when my husband needed a new screen protector I felt this would be best Unfortunately it has already broken If they stand by their lifetime guarantee then my rating will go up to a 5 ,positive
Great InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Protects my Samsung Galaxy S7 device with this InvisibleShield glass screen cover Featuring fortified tempered glass construction this cover defends against scratches to extend your screen ’ s life ,negative
Simple item and doesnt its job so cant complain much strangely it seems to gap in clean line on both sides as if for the edge instead of the regular s7 Now due to that gap its cracked along an edge but its still working so functionality matters most ,negative
This did not fit to the edge of my s7 it had a halo around all the edges I could not get used to the look Very disappointed Do not buy Zagg is working on making a glass screen protector for this phone you can ask Zagg to email you when one is available I suggest waiting ,negative
This was so slick The salesperson put on in store Immediately adheres to screen and is clear without bubbles My husband got one for his too His cracked on the side within days not sure what happened there but received a replacement free of charge We both have been pleased ,positive
I have always liked my Zagg protectors on other phones but due to the slight curve on the S7 this protector wouldnt adhere to the edges and left an easy gap to peal off Returned very easily to Best Buy No complaints with the service just a poorly designed product ,negative
I love that the screen protector looks and feels like the plain screen of the phone but the edges of this protector did not glue tight to the screen and made my new phone look used and beat up Ended up removing and buying a better brand online ,positive
I told the salesman I wanted one of those screen savers for my phone and he pick this one out and was good enough to install it on my phone for me He did a good job and I dont even notice that it is even on it It is clear and will help save my screen from getting mark up ,positive
My screen looks cracked Hopefully it is the Zagg glass screen I will find out when I bring it in to Best Buy to check out The glass screen makes a great display It is clear and smudgeless Zagg always stands behind their products so I am hopeful to have it replaced ,positive
I bought one of these after I broke the glass on my Galaxy S7 about 2 weeks later the phone slipped from my hands and landed dead on it face on jagged rocks and the screen protector cracked but my phone was fine 35 bucks is much better than 200 to replace the screen ,negative
This was recommended by Best Buy personnel DO NOT GET IT It will leave the edges unsealed I spoke with ZAGG about this and they have another product for the nonEDGE S7 that they sell that Best Buy does NOT sell get it from them ,positive
I will say that this item does what it is supposed to do I dropped my phone and it shattered the screen protector My phone screen however was completely intact Definitely worth the I paid for it I use this with the otter box defender case ,positive
doesnt fit phone properly thus cracking at the edges Its a poor design I wouldnt recommend this product if you want to keep you phone looking nice It is under warranty but I dont want to have to go back in every couple of weeks and replace my screen protector ,positive
This screen protector was recommended by the Samsung rep as well as the Best Buy employee and Im not happy that they did not know it would not fit the phone correctly Lots of dirty gets stuck under the edge because it does not fit the screen correctly Otherwise it is fine ,positive
Phones these days are basically just mini computers with price tags to match I wouldnt let my investment go unprotected These work exceptionally well and they are guaranteed a free replacement if they crack as long as you register your purchase ,positive
Overall I like this screen protector It went on relatively easily without too many bubbles However I am concerned that the area along both the left and right edges of the screen protector dont appear to be completely adhering to the phones screen ,positive
This is not the best protector for your phone but it does cover you screen and protect it You will notice on the side of the protector that it doesnt completely stick to your phone I have dust collecting on the sides But it is doing exactly as advertised ,positive
Within a couple days after the screen protector was applied to my phone by a Best Buy sales associate it had already started to chip and actually cut my finger when I was reaching in my purse to get the phone It also has a huge bubble on the top left side ,positive
This is not a good screen cover and I would not recommend it Within a few days of install by the Best Buy Geek squad it started peeling back and coming off I was given a replacement and it did the same thing For the cost you would think it would stay on for a while ,positive
My Galaxy s7 has the curved screen edges This shield appeared to not cover the screen enough and would cause a problem with the edges lifting up from use I found a case that included a screen protector and meets my high standard of protecting a very expensive phone ,negative
I purchased 2 new phones and wanted a reliable screen protector The sales associate recommended this product 2 weeks later one of the screen protectors is cracked on the side which could easily cut fingers I am giving this a 2 star rating because of this ,positive
The edges of the S7 screen are apparently slightly curved However this screen protector apparently is not The edges of the protector never adhered to the screen edges As a result several cracks developed in the edges of the screen protector ,negative
I have dropped my phone a couple of times while trying to juggle too many items and the only damage I have is to the corner of my shield glass No damage to the actual phone glass I have been using these shields for the past 4 years and love them ,negative
Great screen protector Honestly my favorite thing about it is not having to clean the screen simply wipe it with a clean cloth Only reason for 4 stars is even the standard S7 has a slight curve on the edges of the screen so interacting with the edges can be difficult ,positive
The protector is good until it broke very easily while my charger hit the top Its not very good protection but when its brand new it feels so smooth The guy who put it on did a good job but these bubble marks were around the sides ,positive
I do not recommend this tempered glass screen for the Galaxy S7 Because the S7 has a slight curve on the side it leaves giant space between the screen of my phone and the tempered glass allowing dust and other funny stuff to get inside I suggest the HDX instead ,negative
Goddmaybe even very good It does have a small chip now It doesnt bother me My granddaughter dropped my phone on concrete It bounced but didnt break Without the shield Im sure there would have been major damage ,negative
Ive used other brands of screan protectors before Zagg has always been the best NOT in this case The halo allows for the screan protector alows ot to lift up and if you have a case on the phone its even worse It pushes on it too Very disappointed ,negative
It was difficult to install and if you mess up the installation the product is ruined Once it is installed it easily scratches on the surface While not on your screen it becomes difficult to see when they build up over time ,negative
Easy to install Does what it says and has prevented scratches and breaks TO MY SCREEN But simply dropping it in my pocket with other items will cause it to be scratched and busted causing the purchase of another one Drop the price ,negative
I tried cheaper brand screen protectors The protector itself cracked up so couldnt view phone screen Zagg worth the money Performs as stated though did not last a full year Perhaps warranty would cover it My first Zagg lasted 6 months ,positive
I really bought it for my Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge phone because this is what popped up there when I typed in the search bar online for the screen protector for it Its an okay one for the Samsung Galaxy s7 phone If I had to go with a different one I would ,negative
Glass is simple to install and has a lifetime guarantee I had one break on a previous phone and getting a replacement was simple Only issue I have with this one is that it is difficult to get the glass on with 0 air trapped but its a minor thing ,negative
Bought the glass screen cover after best buy employee recommendation It cracked and started peeling in the front by camera lense within 3 weeks Didnt drop phone or anything else to cause it on my end Took it back and got it replaced So far so good with this one ,positive
I love Zagg but this protector isnt a good match for the S7 The S7 has a slightly curved screen unlike the S7 Edge which has a fully curved screen and the protector is about 18116 short of sticking to the full screen I expect better from Zagg ,positive
The product halos which means it doesnt form fit and all around the shield it pops up a little It keeps popping off And it is super irritating And it doesnt span across the entire screen This sucks I wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE ,negative
I purchased this product for my previous phone and after dropping my phone 1000 times or so I finally cracked my screen protector Zagg replaced it quickly and easily no problem Its an excellent product saves me from my clumsiness and I am a fan for life ,negative
The protector is very nice in the middle but it doesnt curve for the edge of the screen There is a halo all the way around that doesnt touch Being inside my pocket it gets little pieces of things underneath it ,positive
I have dropped my phone way too much The Zagg glass protector has just a tiny crack along the edge I know it has been protecting my phone so that glass on the phone itself hasnt cracked Phew ,negative
The screen protector is okay when using your phone but when the phone is off you can see an edge all the way around the phone as if the screen protector isnt sticking correctly ,positive
This product is good to protect scratches but I dont think it is worth the retail price they are charging for it When talking to a Best Buy associate they informed me BB would price match Amazon which saved me a about 40 For that price I think it is a good deal ,positive
The S7 provides me with a much clearer and brighter screen It is much easier to delete calls and EMails as a group I read facebook a lot and the quality of pictures etc Is great I am thoroughly enjoying my n ew S7 phone ,positive
The Zagg invisible glass shield is protective for the screen of my Samsung S7 That should be expected The fit to the screen is not very good The shield lifts at the edges and in one corner of the screen the shield has cracked because of this problem ,negative
Crystal clear protection for your phones screen It has a nice natural feel to the touch screen when applied The only down side is that it does crack more easily than other screen protectors Better for the protector to crack than the screen itself however ,positive
Seemed very nice at the beginning My toddler got ahold of my phone and dropped it The screen protector is cracked Although I am happy nothing happened to the phone It was less than a foot drop for the protector to break I will be calling for a replacement ,negative
I am not thrilled with it but it is ok enough that I will live with it The problem is the the S7 has a slight bevel to the glass so this overlay does not seal tight on the edges As a result it collects little dust crumbs that make me crazy Bleh ,negative
Had one on my last phone and it lasted two and a half years before I replaced my phone It had only a couple of small cracks from dropping the phone but better Zagg protection then cracking my phone screen I will keep buying ZAGG screen protectors ,positive
Dont know what happened Have never dropped the phone but this has cracked on one phone after two months I am using it with a Samsung flip cover so that front of the phone and so this screen protector is always covered when the phone is not actually in use ,negative
These glass screen protectors work great and have saved my sons screen from cracking on his Samsung phone The screen protector cracked but not the actual screen Zagg does charge a 599 shipping and handling fee but replaces the protector at no cost ,positive
Very easy to install very clear like the glass It broke in the first week Best Buy exchanged but I hope I dont have to do that every week If you use outside or in a car it is impossible to read if you have polarized lens Must be the anti glare they put on it ,negative
I installed the Zagg myself which is not my strong suit I have to admit its easy to do but you only have one shot at getting it right If money is not an option it is far easier to pay Best Buy to install the shield but this one is easy enough to do by yourself ,positive
Have used zagg products on my last few phones They work well and do their job They do Crack after a decent fall since they are glass but the warranty makes up for a replacement just paying for shipping Which is minimal cost compared to replacing a phone screen ,positive
The glass is clear and allows a easy view of all icons Application was a little trickey since its a 1 shot deal I could not get all the air bubbles and while trying to reajust the scene it cracked ,positive
the glass dont curve with the phone the edge did not stick return it the first time cause thought it was a defect from me putting it so pay them to put on and said the glass will curved after couple days but never did and started to crack around the edge ,negative
Recently the screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S7 shattered I went to Best Buy where a courteous and knowledgeable Best Buy employee expertly and quickly replaced the screen protector My phone looks as it did when I purchased it Thanks Best Buy ,positive
This product does not fit the S7 phone Mine cracked during the install so I returned it to the local retailer The phone has a slight curve on the edge and the screen protector is completely flat leaving a slight gap on the sides Horrible product ,negative
This screen protector will probably work fine however per the store clerk for some reason the edge all the way around has a slight lip due to the S7 screen being slightly beveled I think its still the best choice for the phone ,positive
Screen protector works well but it doesnt fit the screen of the phone correctly The edge of the phone is slightly curved and the glass cover doesnt bend You end up with a halo around the edge of the phone and dust can gather underneath that edge ,positive
Best screen protector but the glass screen protector for galaxy 7 does not seal around the edge of the screen The screen slightly curves and the glass protector doesnt adhere to it Great product with a slight problem Hopefully Zagg will come up with a solution ,negative
This is my second screen saver for this phone The first one did its job and protected my phone when if fell out of my pocket Im sure this one will do the same It also has a lifetime warranty if you register it I didnt do this on the first one ,negative
Ive bought Zagg products in the past and I bought this based on my experience with them The protector is great Very clear It does not go to the edges of the phone and mine is lifting up a little bit because of this But overall great product ,positive
I found this product to be everything it said it would be It is in my purse and has not suffered scratches from keys pens etc My only complaint is that it could be a tad bigger It doesnt comepletely cover my screen But I would definitely recommend it ,negative
I bought this took it back I got told I only had 15 days of purchase 53 for this screen protector and 8 to put it on NEVER AGAIN I am going to cancel my membership No way am I going to spend money there again ,negative
Ive bought a few Zagg shields in the past for other phones always great easily applied to phone never crack or anything This one did not go on my new phone as smoothly Galaxy 7 AND the shield actually brokeshattered at one of the edges no idea how ,positive
I was hesitant about using the glass protector as opposed to the screen protector that came with my OtterBox I went ahead and applied it which was very easy it covers the screen nicely and does not inhibit the touchpad screen ,negative
I purchased this item bc i had something similar on my last phone The shield was super simple to put on and it hasnt moved since It keeps my phone protected and it hasnt shown signs of peeling or anything like that Will recommend product and brand ,positive
The screen protector doesnt quite fit right The edges of the s7 screen are slightly curved and the protector is totally flat I got it only a few weeks ago and its already cracked Waiting for the proper fitting screen protector to come out before I replace it ,positive
The best part of this product was the small additional fee I paid to have it installed The Best Buy sales person puts them on all the time and she installed mine in record time with no bubbles alignment errors or other common problems ,negative
Annoying prism effect on edges Item cracked after less than 3 weeks and I did not drop the phone A warranty replacement will cost 5 for shipping and I dont want another glass one so have ordered a set of plastic ones ,negative
Zagg is my go to screen protector for all of the phones Ive had and its the one I recommend to family and friends With free lifetime replacement for as long as you have the device its a great deal so just spend the extra money on it in the beginning ,positive
Previous Zagg glass were awesome This one didnt fit the slight radius leftright edges on the S7 Left an annoying 116 strip not adhered took less than a week to get caught and I removed it The S7 is durable with out it ,positive
I like the overall protection and warranty but really wish Zagg could figure out how to get the protector to cover ALL of the screen including the curved edges I already have a small crack on the edge of my screen at the edge of the ZAGG shield ,positive
Have used Zagg protectors before Great product Perfectly clear and easy to apply Purchased online late one evening and picked it up at a local Best Buy the next day after work It was on sale that week so that was an extra bonus ,positive
This is designed to prevent glass scratches or breakage saving you hundreds of dollars in repairs or replacement Best part is if you damage it LIFE TIME WARRANTY just register it on line That in itself will save you money in the future ,negative
Best screen protection you can buy My only negative comment is the halo around the edge of the phone It doesnt really stand out or anything but it does appear to ever so slightly degrade the touch sensitivity around the left and right edges but its not bad ,negative
I always get a screen protector for my phones and so far Im vey happy with the quality of protection this screen protector has given me Its hardly noticeable made of quality material adheres well and smudges wipe clean easily with a soft cloth ,positive
Wonderful little item that not only would I recommend but suggest that you pay the Geek Squad to put it on 800 The first one they did had some air bubbles so they broke open a new box and did it again Not an option when you try it yourself ,negative
we just recently got our phones put the Zagg shield on it and my husbands already broke i understand we can send it back and get a new one FREE but its a hassle to have to do that already and then to put it on again so far mine is ok ,negative
The process of putting this on was actually pretty easy Ive used other brands that would be off or short and wouldnt cover the whole screen Ive been using these for a while and it really does help the protection of the screen ,positive
Very disappointed with this product edges of glass do not lay flat on screen Was told this at store once it was put on all Zagg S7 shields fit like that Returned it immediately Have always purchased Zagg shields and first issue with the product ,negative
Always trust Zagg products protection you can trust I have purchased other brands in the past but have come to the conclusion on investing in buying Zagg products first I no longer buy other brands of any type of screen protection its a waste of money ,positive
Love the glass protector Although I did have to have the first one replaced as it wasnt properly adhered to the phone and it cracked Best Buy replaced it as it was only a day old New one adhered properly has has kept my phone screen in good shape ,positive
I dropped my phone down a flight of wood stairs It bounced three times The screen protector cracked in 3 places but the screen underneath was left completely unscathed Excellent product I replaced with the same product because it worked so well ,positive
I recently purchase a Samsung Galaxy S7 I bought the screen protector with it because the Best Buy associate suggested it she also installed it for me and told me about the lifetime warranty it was a great purchase and I definitely recommend it ,positive
Helps protect your screen very well Dropped my cellphone several times and protected it better than my expectations It eventually cracked but helped out a lot Still using it need to use the warranty to get another one Very satisfied with the product ,positive
I got this screen protector from Best Buy about a month ago and I am really please with it It is invisible on the phone and it has made my phone look like a new phone I have dropped is a couple times and no hint of any damage ,negative
First one I got for a Galaxy S7 not an Edge did not stick down at edges Could not return to Best Buy and after two tries talking with Zagg they admitted that it was a design flaw and sent a new one at no charge Seems to be OK now ,negative
Have always been impressed with Zagg but not this time Appears they rushed a product to market Halo effect with the flat protector is an visual issue along with a great dustcrud gatherer Your pockets will stay clean because this thing collects all of it ,positive
This was my third purchase for this phone Not happy with quality of product or difficulty of getting replacement Salesperson says at least screen didnt crack ,negative
Does not fit the phone Samsung S7 Edges does not adhere to the sides of the phone causing dust and debris to get stuck Best Buy associate that installed it said that the first ones that come out are not made to size Need to return and get one that fits ,negative
The Zagg Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector is easy to apply unlike the old Zagg protectors where one had to spray the phone or tablet first It does not seem to interfere with touch response and is a quality product I do not regret purchasing this ,negative
This screen protectors fit and finish if very poor it does not fit tight to the screen leaving an air gap around the border which not only looks like bad but allows dust to make its way under the screen protector and the phone ,negative
The HD clarity of the screen protector goes well with the HD quality of the phoneI am happy with the guarantee that is associated with the replacement of the screen protector if any defects may occur I would recommend this product to all my friends ,positive
The edge of the S7 is slightly curved the Zagg is flat I have already cracked 2 in less than a month until they get it to fit properly on the screen I would not buy I do have the lifetime but cmon I dont want to replace it every couple of weeks ,negative
It works good but the outer edge of the shield doesnt stick so it looks like a frame when the phone is not on When the phone is on you dont notice the edges I asked the samsung rep and he said it was a known issue by samsung but they all do this ,positive
These glass screen protectors are nice They are pretty fragile though I have already replaced it once after a week Replacements are free as long as you register your screen protector with the company on their website The clarity of them are good ,positive
I dropped my phone it appeared my phone cracked in the corner top as well as bottom 3 cracks in all I was freaking out and then I peeled the screen saver off and my phone is perfect Love it ,negative
This is actually a replacement after my last protector broke but lets just say that it totally saved my phone Its way better to replace this cracked screen protector rather than replacing a 700 phone Money well spent ,negative
Perfect fit and full coverage of the screen but a little difficult to apply I had the store clear install it because theyve done hundreds It would not be easy for a first time install Easy to wipe clean and has not scratched at all ,positive
This screen protector installed extremely easy but because of the beveled edges of the screen it wont lay flat I called the company and they are aware of the issue and are working on a fix They will send a new one when they are ready for free ,positive
Ive always protected my phone with these screen protectors This time on our new S7s they dont fit rightthey are lifted from edges when I took back to store all they suggested was to exchange with the darker so it couldnt be seen Not cool ,negative
Two thick lines remain on both sides of the phone they do not interfere when the screen is brilliant however they are very noticeable when the screen is off or with low bright It seems to do its function well ,positive
I always have the Zagg protective shield installed on my phone to keep the original glass screen pristine It doesnt interfere with your touch screen sensitivity This is the best company of all the companies that make protective shields ,positive
It does the job The fit isnt great but I guess that is to be expected when you get the phone before it is released to the public At some point I will send it back for a better fit but as always it does a great job protecting an expensive investment ,positive
Ive had 2 of these protectors in less than a year 2nd was purchased few weeks agoalready cracked Also there is some weird halo effect going on around the sides of the screen Im super easy on phones so this product just sucks ,negative
I read all the reviews and this seemed like the best screen protector even though it was the most expensive It was a little tricky to put on but I finally got it done It doesnt show fingerprints and doesnt add a lot of weight to my phone ,negative
This is the second new phone that I have used zagg the first phone it worked great and had to replace it and zagg shipped it right out no charge the stand behind there products and that why I got 2 more 1 for my new phone and 1 for my wife phone ,positive
Ive always had very good luck with all the Zagg screen savers I have purchased They have replaced some in the past no cost to me so Ill keep coming back The one on my last phone cracked but saved the phone screen so it did its job ,positive
The screen protector did not stick to the edges of my s7 The employee apllied two protectors but neither stuck to the edges leaving a halo around the outside of my phone that causes the touchscreen not to work on the edge Useless ,negative
When I purchased my new phone and case the Best Buy clerk suggested I get a glass screen cover Great suggestion It cleans easily doesnt scratch and doesnt distort what is on my phone Thank you Best Buy for pointing me in the right direction ,negative
Let me say I love ZAGG screen protectors and have them on every single screen device I have Bought this and on the very 1st day it suffered a small crack Now after 2 months it has 3 small cracks on it Will be requesting a replacement soon ,negative
I got this for my daughter and it broke after 6 months But my daughter is rough on her phone so that was expected However her phone screen did not crack and they replaced the protector for free so this was a win win situation Very pleased ,positive
Glass cracked and zagg replaced however your responsible for 599 shipping and must register Easy exchange process Glass cracked due to pressure Son laid his head on purse in shopping cart and somehow pressure cracked glass Other than that happy ,negative
We purchased this screen protector because the previous one on the phone did not fit very well it was cheap and from a different manufacturer So far this one looks great visibly clear and no bubbles underneath ,positive
Have I dropped the phone with this screen protector on Yes Did it completely protect the phone screen and only crack the screen protector Yes Does it have life time warranty You bet It just works ,positive
This is my second shield in less than a year I paid best buy both times to put it on but the first time was poorly installed So it got dirty and finally fell off So far this one id better Does crack easily but better than the screen ,negative
My wifes phone was protected by one of these Over a period of a year it took a beating and cracked the phone screen however was undamaged We just applied a new one to the same phone ,negative
i dont know how many times i have dropped my phone and the screen never cracks just the protecter breaks but i had it registered and they sent me a new one right away ,negative
expensive and boyfriend cracked the side of it while putting it on Although even with that is has protected my phone screen ever since I did get a glass sliver in my finger from a piece of the screen that came off which was NOT cool ,negative
Ive now returned 3 Zagg glass covers for my S7 and the protectors do not fit wellDo not buy this product it was not designed nor engineered well and is not worth itZagg did not account for the slight curvature of the screen on the S7 ,positive
I prefer the Invisible HD Screen protector I am accustomed to and returned this glass I found that it tended to pop upbubble at the edges It seems to have trouble staying secured because of its rigidity unlike the flexible Invisible HD shield ,negative
This is a nice screen protector its very clear and cleans nicely My only complaint is that Ive found that it takes a little more pressure when typing since this screen protector is a little thicker its just a slight relearning process ,positive
I have had these screen protectors on several phones All have cracked or broken within two weeks of application But the phone glass is not broken which is why I have the protector on So its doing its job and Zagg has a lifetime replacement policy ,negative
I would not recommend putting this on yourself Maybe with practice these are easy to put on but I would definitely pay someone to do it for you Other than that the functionality of it and quality is great ,positive
Ive tried a lot of different screen protector products but Zagg tempered glass protectors are the only ones that have never failed me Im hard on phones this product with its lifetime warranty is the best accessory that you can buy for your phone ,negative
Seems to be a great item but install it carefully Too much pressure will cause cracks Corners are the most sensitive areas The plastic screen protectors might be a better buy for the money Will be good item for a phone ,positive
This one doesnt fit the Samsung S7 exactly right but it definitely protected my screen When I had to replace it I tried another brand that fit better and cost less Fail I lost screen sensitivity so I had to buy the Zagg one again ,positive
Ever since I discovered Zagg its been the only screen protector I use on my mobile devices Ive even introduced my husband to the Zagg screen protector and hes as pleased as I am with the product I have recommended it to all my friends ,positive
I purchased this on my daughters recommendations to go with her new phone I was a little skeptical at first because of it being glass but once it was installed I was so happy I did get it Its a great feature to add to her phone ,positive
Zagg needs to redesign this screen protector to curve with the glass of the Galaxy7 Current model leaves edges exposed allowing for dust particles to get under The part of the screen covered is great allowing for lifetime warranty is fantastic ,positive
About an 18 to 14 of the protector along the entire left and right side of protector does not fully adhere to the screen The protector does not appear to match contourprofile of the standard S7 phone screen ,positive
The protector has worked well so far but the rounded edges of the screen have made it difficult Even with the phone case the protector chipped the first time I dropped it Still keeps my phone safe though And I love the lifetime warranty ,positive
Not sure why this cracked I went back with my receipt to exchange and was very disappointed in the service received Apparently this is warrantied but I have to pay shipping for it That will add up especially since this cracked after 3 weeks ,negative
This is a great product in that it covers the entire screen and is glass 9H However the adhesive is only around the edges and does not adhere to the entire screen This can interfere with some of the touch sensitivity ,negative
Bought screen saver at Best Buy in mall Young lady that helped me removed the old screen saver and attached new screen saver as I watched Very thankful for her doing everything for me rather than me messing it up ,positive

I believe in screen savers as I plan to keep this expensive new phone for a long time The edge is barely noticeable I notice no difference in phone usability I am pleased with everything except the very high cost of this screen saver ,positive
It doesnt fit completely over the phone making textinginputting full of errors I was told the halo would improve but it hasnt Would like to know if I can get my money back Not worth the cost but definitely not worth the aggravation ,positive
I Love Zagg shields I dont buy any devices without buying a Zagg shield They protect the screen from getting damaged and their replacement warranty is worth the purchase I have had to replace a few screen protectors and its an easy process ,positive
All of the reviews are correct The glass does not fit the slight curve of the screen leaving the sides unattached A simple catch on anything in my wifes purse will rip the glass off Horrible design ,negative
This is the second time I have purchased this for a phone They are great Still touch sensitive but protect the screen from shattering Have otterbox but dropped phone on pointed object The glass shield cracked but no injury to phone ,negative
I love these screen protectors Mines coming off a bit already Im not sure if its from being put on wrong or not but other than that these are great to have Saves me so many times when dropping my phone on concrete floors at work ,positive
Zagg has been a great product for my family in the past The edges of the screen protector chip away easily I guess it is better the protector than my phone screen The protector is easy to install and i have a clear view of my screen ,positive
I bought this for my last phone Galaxy Note 5 and it saved me from having to replace the screen Old phone took quite a beating from 3 young boys but I peeled off the screen protector the screen looked brand new ,negative
Zagg should not have come out with this project It did not fit and left a horrible fog around the edge I love Zagg Products but this one came to the market too fast Get the new updated curved glass It fits perfect and does not break as easy ,positive
Im not to happy with this product The whole screen saver cracked in half after 3 months Im very careful with my phone This shield comes with a lifetime warranty which is great because Ill be calling for my 3rd screen within a year ,positive
Easy application My 7 year old even commented on how smooth it feels on the screen Prevents scratches well I have dropped my phone a few times and this prevented any damage that could have occurred ,negative
It is a quality product but I am having some problems with the touch recognition on the outside edge because the Samsung Galaxy S7 screen wraps is beveled The screen protector does not sit flush on the phone around the outside edge ,negative
I always buy a screen protect with the purchase of a new phone Zagg has always been my first choice when it comes to screen protectors This protector is ok but it doesnt fit securely on the sides of the screen Thats my only grip ,positive
Having a glass shield on my cell phone is a must I have used this product on all of my cell phones and it definitely is worth the cost It not only is added protection but it is easy to clean the many fingerprints it gets on a daily basis ,positive
Broke after first day I payed 40 for it at 8pm the next morning I wake up and it was all ready cracked It nice if u can keep it that way Every one I know that has one theres I broken as well It nice my screen is buffered but it seems cheap ,positive
Didnt even drop it i layed on it in hoodie pouch edge chipped Took it to customer service to return and it broke in half when i removed it Then Best Buy refused to refund threw 40 bucks in the garbage DO NOT BUY ,negative
The middle of the glass screen looks great just like every other glass screen made by zagg Unfortunately the edge is awful as it is curved and the glass doesnt adhere Will be returning as the fit is bad ,negative
I just brought this product 2 months ago and its already damaged It has a few small cracks on the edge of both sides which eventually caused a crack line across the screen protector It suppose to be a strong product but its not ,negative
I always opt for a quality screen protector and a cheap fun case ZAGG didnt fail me on a Galaxy 5 for 2 years and so far this one is holding up as well Only complaint the edges are peeling up a bit on the sides ,negative
This is also very good protection for your cell The only negative I have is that I sometimes have to poke my finger on the screen pretty hard for it to be sensed by my touch screen Other than that it is a good protector ,positive
I purchased this guard for my new phone Nice and crystal clear while offering maximum protection to the glass front of my phone Came with a lifetime guarantee from the manufacturer I had the Best Buy employee attach it for me Great job ,positive
Ive had two of these now each one chipping on alternate sides within a day or two of applying My wife has the same phone and same screen protector with no issues Zagg does offer replacement but it shouldnt chip within a day ,negative
This screen protector is designed to go on a flat screen and does not work on the S7 It sticks up around the edges and cracks constantly Im on my second one in a little over a month and it already has a chip in the corner ,negative
I didnt like this one because it broke after 2 weeks and 1 little drop I had a protective case too But zagg replaced with better one So i liked that I would recommend the brand but not that certain screen ,positive
The screen protector is easy to keep clean and it does keep my phone screen from getting scratched It was a little challenging to put on wo air bubbles appearing on the screen ,negative
I have a work phone that is touch screen BlackBerry and my experience with that is to say eh But my Galaxy 7 Edge is quite easy to use I like the fact you can set your favorites such as contacts or apps on the edge which makes quick use ,positive
The screen protector doesnt fit the screen as it should i was in contact with Zagg and it is a known problem Zagg themselves has pulled the product from their site for sale until it is fixed I wonder why Best Buy continues to sale it ,negative
Im still up in the air with this screen protector Ive had zagg products in the past but this particular protector already cracked the first week I got my phone I just got the replacement so Ill cross my fingers in hopes this one will work ,negative
This has held up well in the past month it is a must have for the line of work I do on locomotives but so far it has withstood many things I messed up putting it on so there is one little bubble but other than that has been working great ,positive
I always get Zagg screen protectors They do a fantastic job of protecting However there seems to be a region that doesnt adhere to the screen along the edge Its about 116 wide Not distracting though ,negative
Because of the natural curve on the edges of my Galaxy S7 this screen protector kept cracking and breaking while in my pocket due to no support on the edges I went through 6 these in one month not a good buy for this device ,positive
My only issue and its certainly not this glass cover for my phone but the darn things get so messy with fingerprints Seems I am constantly wiping it clean But thats all glass protectors so Im really not complaining ,negative
Best buy had wrong price registerThey correctedProduct is great Great warrantyFit the screen well Easy to install Best buy wanted a lot to install Do it yourself ,positive
Within a month the screen saver was starting to come off My husband had his replaced already My last screen saver lasted a year before showing sign of wear and tear For 40 Im not thrilled but I know the alternative is worse ,positive
Ive always believed in the ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector It it definitely made for the intent of protection of the phone Ive dropped my phone several times and the Invisible Shield does its job ,positive
Does the packaging say invisible I think it does Thats because it is invisible The perfect addition to my phone No issues with it at all Cant tell you how many times this has saved my screen A great product ,negative
I wanted something that I could easily position without air bubbles and easily remove when needed This one has all those features and a free warranty ,positive
The product scratches very easily Within 2 week and just leaving the glass on my dresser it obtain marks within the glass The glass is still intact and overall protects the phone but the screen is not as good as quality for the price paid ,negative
Bought this for my new Galaxy s7 After purchasing it and having Best Buy install it it would not lay down on the edges because the s7 screen curves down slightly on the edges Took it back however and they refunded it no questions asked ,positive
I absolutely love this screen protector It glides real smooth when swiping it cleans up super easy it provides no glare or reflection and it hasnt broken yet even though I drop my phone every once in a while ,positive
This is a great product The sales rep put it on the phone for me Unfortunately they charge a fee to do this but she did a great job making sure there were no air bubbles ,positive
Glass cover cracked within first few months of use A fantastic plus is that the product holds true to its warranty I registered the product and ZAGG sent me a brand new one in the mail All I had to do was mail back the cracked one ,negative
2 other Samsung owners recommended this product to me now I will join to recommend to others A lifetime warranty will make sure your screen remains intact Worth the extra fee to have Best Buy do the install ,positive
It does the job of protecting my screen glass very well No problems or complaints Also it seems easier to clean fingerprints and smudges than the original glass that came on the Samsung Galaxy S7 ,negative
But if a halo doesnt bother you then i would recommend this I hated the rubber one I had on my old phone This HD glass protector has great picture and actually feels like you are using the screen on your phone ,positive
The overall shape of the glass is correct however the edge of the phone tapers off The Zagg glass is prone to crack around the edges this is now my 2nd Zagg screen for the S7 and it is already crackingZagg has been informed ,negative
Only complaint is that the shield does not rest completely on the edge to the phone There is a seal for the shield but about 14 in on the left and right sides and 18 in on the top and bottom that it doesnt adhere to the phone ,positive
The screen protector is a little thicker than other ones I have had in the past but seems to work just fine It probably offers more protection than some of the thinner ones out there ,positive
I wasnt sure about buying this when my salesman showed it to me but Im glad I did Adds to the water resistency of the phone and it was inexpensive Request price match for a lower price ,positive
Should have gotten this from the start Phone cracked with another screen protector but this one does a good job and comes with lifetime warranty ,negative
I have one from a previous phone purchase Good product My problem is that Best buy suggested this for a new phone purchase It does NOT fit a galaxy J7 It was suggested to buy at check out so we did and we had to return it ,negative
After replacing my s7 I searched for a screen protector and decided on this one Within 4 hours the screen was cracked I does not fit fully on the screen I think that is why it cracked to easily ,negative
Could barely see my screen in the sun with this was like a hazy residue underneath Then a few days later the shield just uplifted peeled off and cracked in multiple areas during that process Dont waste your money on this product ,negative
I have used many Zagg products and this one is no different than the rest Its always well worth the purchase especially considering that the warranty is for life I would highly recommend the product for all your electronic products ,positive
Product is greatcomes with a warranty Only problem is that mine has little cracks along the side because it doesnt contour exactly to the phone This is ultimately not a big deal and is still worth the ,negative
Zagg quality has gone down since last time I bought This does not fitcover the screen good It got scratches on it right away just by typing on the phone i have no nails never in pocket or purse ,positive
Its just ok I had it put on at the store It doesnt sit right on the s7 and has air pockets on each side It also got a small Crack the first dayI didnt drop it or anything I guess at least my phone screen isnt cracked ,negative
The rubbery protection started developing bubbles and didnt look good This looks like a seamless glass cover Hopefully will stand the test with a teenager ,positive
I will never use a plastic screen protector again On a clean screen it was super easy to apply Because its glass its really easy to get air bubbles out as it doesnt flex Plus it feels the same as the screen ,positive
I highly recommend staying away from this product Does not adhere to outer edges of screen halo effect and Best Buy slash Geek Squad charges 8 to put it on when its 39 to begin with ,positive
I had it installed at the store it has this weird halo effect on the outer edges The lady who installed it said thats how its supposed to look but its gotten worse in a week IDK may try something else next time ,negative
I have had a hard time with cell phones I never wanted to pay for a screen protecter and I pai the price by having my nice phones look horrible from scratches This Zagg screen protecter has kept my phone scratch free and looking good ,negative
The product works as advertised When I placed it on my phone it went on slightly to the side and I wasnt able to move itThis has kept it from fully sticking to the phone Make sure you put it on straight ,positive
Based on everything that I had read concerning this screen protector I wasnt sure if I was going to like it I purchased it knowing about the halo affect so I cant complain about that and everything else appears to be fine ,positive
This shield protector is one of the most amazing things Ive ever encountered It literally deflected a nail gun nail and left the phone screen intact without a nick or a scratch and possibly prevented me from getting injured ,negative
The shield works well preventing my S7 from cracks Came unglued at edge glad I paid for it to be replaced that saved me big Only drawback is you have to tap the screen harder and sometimes multipule times ,positive
I just love this clear glass shield on my phoneMy fingers just glide easily across the screenand the appearance is enhanced by its clarity making my phone much easier to read do my business ,positive
The zag screen cover is great I dropped my phone face down on a concrete floor and and it wasnt damaged at all That being said the price was pretty high for the product plus Best Buy charged to install it ,positive
This shield is great for protecting your phones glass from shattering I see so many phones that have cracked glass on them I actually dropped my phone which I never do and the shield cracked not my phone It is truly a phone saver ,negative
Great product I bought it for my teenage son that continually drops his phone and while the product cracked it protected the phone I believe they will also send you a new one if you are registered ,negative
I had Zagg sheilds on phonmes in the past and appreciated the way they prevented finferprints and smudges This HD Glass version is even better as it adds a thicker layer that protects the scrren to a greater degree ,negative
was told it was the best unfortunately the product was the opposite for me gave the product a week to settleform on the edges of phone screen lifted on both outer edges of phone instead of the latter ,negative
This screen protector is overall pretty good The only problem is that it doesnt curve with the edges of the galaxy s7 screen which leaves an unattached 18 section on both sides But to me thats not a big issue ,negative
The invisible shield is of great quality It is easily applied to the screen even by a novice It is clear and provides good visibility to your phone screen It has provided amazing protection to my phone screen ,positive
definitely not thrilled with the way this fits the phone it does not cover the entire screen therefore leaving a gap and the edges dont stay sealed to screen It was a waste of money for me as I ended up just taking it off ,negative
We never buy a phone without having a Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector installed before we leave Best Buy They do a great job of installing it and the Shield does a great job of protecting the screen of your new phone ,positive
Pleased with this for the most part Only thing I dislike is the sides dont stay down completely That might be due to operator error upon putting the protector on the phone did it myself But its not too bad Overall a good buy ,negative
My wife is rough with her phone Needless to say this replacement is worth it rather than paying for the phone replacement or repair that would have happened if it hadnt been there Nice save ,negative
As expensive as phones are I feel like I cant afford to not protect the screen Although a bit pricey this screen protector fits the bill and has a warranty should it ever be damaged or fail I would definitely recommend ,negative
I have always put zagg glass protectors on all of my phones and they have always kept my screen in mint condition Even though it leaves a slight border on both sides of the screen due to the new design It still protects the phone ,negative
Looks great when you first install it but it cracks very easy and looks bad They say they will will replace it but what a pain to go through there process I would rather buy another brand and get on with my life ,negative
This protection has saved the screen on my phone from damage many times It is much better to damage the protector than damage the touch screen Best Buy is truly THE BEST GREAT support and the Geek Squad is truly World Class ,negative
I always choose Zagg not only for their reliable product but for the awesome lifetime warranty that goes with it If the glass screen cracks simply contact them for a replacement You pay shipping only Cant beat that ,positive
The glass protector received cracks in it pretty easily only had for 2 months I will be sending back to replace not sure how well the process will go yet Will only recommend as a result of the ease of replacing for a new one ,positive
Have always used Zagg screen protectors Great warranty and customer service This particular screen protector however doesnt go with the curvature of the screen very well though Not a big deal when you have a case though ,positive
It seemed easy enough to put on and is clear and has no problems with the touch pad working but in trying to get out a bubble as per the instructions the edge shattered Will try to get another ,positive
Works fine but I feel that I have to put extra pressure around the sides and bottom when using keyboard or any touch function Samsung S7 is beveled around the screen edges so I feel they could make a protective screen to match ,positive
I purchased this product to protect my phone as I had broken the screen on my last phone This phone fell from counter height striking the base of a stool The Zagg cracked but my screen didntnew Zagg on my phone now ,negative
This was a replacement purchase When i contacted Zagg I received excellent service and they replaced the replacement with no shipping charge because of the issue I originally purchased the replacement at Best Buy ,negative
Although the Zagg screen protectors are quite expensive they are well worth the money My phone inevitably hits the ground at least a half dozen times a week but with my Zagg protection I have never had a screen shatter ,negative
Very expensive for a single piece but this is what my daughter wanted Did not fit the S7 normal very wellthe edges were not tight It will work which gets a star but sheesh no ,negative
We went through several of these before finally giving up Just the slightest little jar would begin to crack the screen protector It did protect the screen but we had to go back to the store to exchange every week or 2 ,negative
This is my second screen protector Great at protecting from dirt and scratches Theres a halo on the edges on my S7 not the Edge but combined with a protective case its saved my phone numerous times A must have for sure ,negative
I am sure there are cheaper options out there but it was for my teenage sons phone and I needed something I knew would work well We have had for a couple months so far and several drops late its still staying strong ,positive
doesnt grip the edges put on 2x by geek squad and the product is not what it should be for the pricealready cracking at the top and by the menu button with no dropping of the phone ,positive
I had it installed by Geek Squad when i bought it Within an hour the very edges on the sides came up about 116 in from the outside edge A few chips have come off since then Phone has been in a case since i bought it ,negative
This is a replacement purchase The 1st one had many cracks I was leaning toward a different screen protector but this was the only one available in store It was over half off so Im giving it a second chance ,negative
Bought two for our new S7s Think the product is better than the earlier vinyl version we had on our LG G2s Bought another one for the S2 Galaxy Tablet So easy to put on I did it myself and avoided GEEK Squad costs ,positive
Bought mine about a month ago and it has already starting developing pit marks The edges are coming off They want me to pay for another one so the warranty is useless Wasted my money on this one No more Zagg for me ,negative
The samsung phone is curved and the edges of the screen protector dont stick down and is mildly annoying Its like a ring around the collar But after a few days you wont even notice anymore ,negative
This glass screen protector was highly recommended by the sales associate and after having it for more than two weeks now I can definitely say that it works great It doesnt smudge and there are still no scratchesI like it ,positive
I like how the protector covers the original phone screen However It is slightly larger than the screen and debris will collect on the edge of the screen However I also could not register this product on its website ,positive
Im a klutz and the glass screen protector takes the hit instead of my phone The only time it hasnt worked was when I was too lazy to put it on Unlimited exchanges for 7 a piece included shipping ,negative
This is the first Zagg product I have owned that doesnt fit right It is too wide and leaves a slight dead zone near the left and right edges Im almost hoping it comes off soon so I can replace it with another brand ,positive
had trouble with previous protectors due to the curved edges of the screen This protector does not extend all the way to the edge so stays in place better and doesnt get pulled loose by a case ,negative
Zagg screen protectors are great I only have one issue with this screen protector and that is it doesnt fit the screen correctly due to the curvature of the screen so the outside edges dont completely seal like they should ,positive
I really did not like this product Had it for a week it had already cracked without me ever dropping it Got it replaced and within 3 days it had cracked again I just gave up at that point and asked for a refund ,negative
I liked the thickness of the shield The reason I gave it a 4 star is it doesnt fit the Samsung Galaxy S7 properly The edge of the phone curves and the shield does not bend So to me it doesnt fit the phone correctly ,positive
After getting one crack on the screen protector it has done a great job of protecting the screen on my phone I like that it does not chip away when it does get broken into it is pretty durable and reliable for the most part ,positive
I like the protection this screen protector offers but I do not like the bubbled edges Maybe the associate that installed it simply put it on wrong but it looks ugly with a lifted bubbled look all the way around the edges ,positive
I have owned ZAGG protectors in the past and they were great then and remain great The 7 has a slight roll on the long sides and unfortunately this protector doesnt exactly conform so there is a little gap down both sides ,positive
I think I need a better phone case to protect the screen saver Ive purchased two of these and both of them have chipped when Ive dropped the phone But I think a phone case that protects it would help solve the problem ,positive
Seems good but is already popping off my screen Edges dont go all the way down best buy employee who put it on said thats normal I dont know if its an issue with the product or with the guy who installed it ,positive
Prior to getting the Zagg invisibleShield my 6 year old dropped the phone at minute maid park while watching you tube and not the Astros The glass lens cracked We are looking forward to the added protection for her new phone ,negative
Yes the glass protection breaks fairly easily with any drop of the phone but it beats your phone screen breaking Love that its life time warranty so when the screen does break you can replace it for free ,negative
Had an issue with screen shield cracking after fews days on phone It wasnt dropped not sure what caused it to crack on side of screen Zagg was contacted sending free replacement so going to try shield again ,negative
Only had protect screen about 2wksprotectscreen alrdy has several chips on it it very clser doesnot tk away from phn screen easy to swipegreat purchasewish would hv brought b4 i crack my phn screen ,positive
I hate these glass protectors It easily chipped on the side Im going back to using wet apply screen protectors I never had a problem with them ,negative
This was the only screen protector the store had available for my phone It is very clear and you wouldnt know that its there but mine developed a crack in the corner a day after it was put on at the time of purchase ,positive
With phones having so many uses in so many areas it is easy to put the phone in harms way and therefore protection is needed to preserve the phone from damage This helps… ,negative
Does not fit the S7 Edges did not get even close to sealing causing it shield to Crack on the edges on day 2 of minimal use Also making it near impossible to use touchscreen on phone without great seal ,negative
Id recommend using Geek Squad for placing shield on the phone after purchase but other than that this shield fits and works fine so far on my Samsung S7 phone Fingers crossed when it drops ,positive
Put this screen on a day after i got my phone the next day i dropped it and it bounced between my tool box and work bench before it hit the ground the cover screen spidered and saved my phonewell worth it ,positive
My wife had this protector installed free over the glass of her phone at Best Buy She loves it is so clear with no bubbles like with most screen protectors You also get a lifetime warranty so you cant go wrong ,positive
I dropped my phone the screen saver cracked in 2 places I had registered it so it was 100 covered Had a new screen cover in 48 hours Best Buy charge 8 to put it on Be sure to register your screen saver ,positive
Ill only purchase Zagg screen protectors Best on the market Lifetime warranty Been using them since my Blackberry days lol Have it installed by a Best Buy employee to prevent frustration ha Great product 5 stars ,negative
I hesitated before buying a screen protector for my new phone as earlier products were difficult to apply This thing attached in seconds with no troubles getting the bubbles out and no debris under it ,negative
Love zagg glass screen protectors Only thing with this one is the phone is slightly curved on the edges its not an edge phone its the correct protector Got a crack on the edge of the screen 1 week later ,negative
The cost of 40 dollars seems excessive at first glance but when you realize if you register the product you can replacements cheap as heck So if you have the money up front go for it If not cheaper alternatives do exist ,negative
Huge fan of invisasheild glass however this one is not made for the phone and its slight curve design not its not for the edge so there is lift on edges So it doesnt have proper fit I hope they redesign soon ,positive
Invisishield Glass is fantastic Have it on all my devices as well as my familys devices It has saved so much money in replacements for phones If it cracks or any defect will be replaced for free by the company ,positive
This is the best screen protector available It is worth the money because if you happen to damage it it is only 5 to replace instead of Ahaving to replace your phone or B having to buy a whole new screen protector ,positive
This product is easy to apply yourself and gives your screen all around protection from side to side and top to bottom Product is clear and easy to see thru and made thick enough for great screen protection ,positive
This isnt well built for the Samsung Galaxy S7 because it doesnt sit correctly on the side due to how they angle This causes it to look beveled Its not a big deal but a little annoying It seems good otherwise ,positive
Bought an open box Had fuzz on protector that was not removable therefore recommend buying new and never removing until you are ready to replace ,positive
The screen is curved a little bit and the screen protector is flat Their for within a few days of installing the edges were all cracked wish the associate would have mentioned that would happen ,negative
But the best thing about this glass breaking is that theres not gon na be a rattlesnake at the end of it But for real this glass is gon na break before the glass on your phone is gon na break and thats its job isnt it ,negative
Feels like nothing is on my screen which is great Paid to have it installed and the guy at Best Buy put it on perfectly Just a little expensive at 40 but Im happy with it Works well with my Tech21 clear case too ,positive
This was recommended by the Samsung rep when I got my Galaxy S7 I previously had another brand on my iPhone and could never see the screen in the sun just overall didnt like it this one however I highly recommend ,positive

Edges dont stick to the screen and chiped on that area scratches easily and all that in less then 30 days and this is the second one they put on because the first one had even a lager area it wouldnt stick to ,negative
My daughter told new about this product and how good it was on her IPhone so I got one for my new S7 so far so good Could fit a little better not as big as the screen itself but with the case I got it works fine ,positive
The Zagg screen protectors saved my last phone screen from shattering so there was no question I would add it to my new phone I recommend everyone gets one because its inevitable that you drop your phone ,negative

Good screen protector I have not had any problems with scratches cleans easily Only problem I have had are little chips at the side because it does not curve to conform to the edge of my screen ,negative
This product does not properly for the galaxy s7 I bought it and had it placed on by the store and it doesnt adhere to the side around the entire screen It sometimes makes pushing enter or search and delete difficult ,negative

I have no complaints about my screen protectorI did have to get it replaced cause somebody dropped something on my phone a chipped it but it didnt harm my actual screen It was replaced free A great smooth surface ,positive
The protector is very clear The protection is supposed to be good I saw similar products work well on other phones Having the lifetime warranty helps since the protector is supposed to crack a lot when impacted ,positive
My daughter cracked her screen so this is more of Bandaid than a true protector but it is containing the crack so she can continue to use the phone until we can afford to replace it ,negative
A little pricey especially at this that this for an S7 and Samsung is now on 9 I was anticipating some kind of discount Mother than that it ’ s and very clear ,negative
Ive bought this twice on my s7 and both times it hasnt sealed properly on the sides I dont think it ever will for anyone Dust gets in there and its very grody and then it breaks easier on the sides ,positive
I do like how this product feels and cleans well due to the glass Very durable but will crack with enough impact Warranty comes with easy replacement just pay the shipping Pretty easy to install as well ,positive
This screen protector sticks up at the edges due to the slightly curved screen of the S7 not edge Has already cracked up and down the sides of the screen protector on my device in less than a month ,negative
Halo around the entire screen protector never went away Started breaking a few days after I had the Best Buy employee place it now in pieces and the adhesive is the only thing holding it together ,negative
I love having this screen protector Bought it because dust kept getting under the screen protector that was on my otter box case Dont have that problem with this at all Would definitely buy again ,negative
Unfortunately the form factor comes up a bit short and allows the sticky edges of this screen protector to morph into a pocket lint and dust magnet and the lint can not be removed as it becomes attached to the glue ,negative
It does its job to protect the screen and warranty replacement is super simple Only reason for 4 stars is even though it is the right one for my phone the fit at the edges is not great ,positive
The shield attached to cell face as directed Ended up buying an OtterBox to protect the cell phone from drops Removed the glass shield as the screen sensitivity was somewhat reduced ,positive
36 hrs after we bought it it was already protecting the brand new phone My son hit it with a baseball The shield showed the web like cracking But it was only the protector The only draw back 1 in a box for 44 ,positive
I have used this one prior cell phones and it has always been great sadly the glass cover is slightly smaller than the actual screen area resulting in a lack of sensitivity at the left and right edges of the display ,negative
Insalled by best buy on the day of purchase Edges immediately cracked Best Buy refused to take it back and had nothing better to replace it with It was a completely adverse experience at Worst Buy ,negative

I have dropped my S5 many times face down and the Zagg tempered glass shield saved the day When I bought my S7 once again I installed the Zagg tempered glass shield it is the cheapest insurance you will ever buy ,positive
Great screen protector but because my galaxy s7s edges curve back slightly the sides of the screen protector dont cover the side edges of the phone Now theres lint collecting on the edges of my cell ,negative

Looks Great Very Clear Replacement for Otter Glass from Costco I dropped on tile floor broke glass Costco couldnt replace Best Buy sold and the Samsung worker installed did a great job ,negative
This is a terrible product that does not function properly Screen protector does not seal around the edges of the phone and allows for debris to get under the protector Do not buy this product for the regular S7 ,negative
This is a good screen protector but the edges are not stuck down so I have to push harder when tapping near the edges Im not sure if the edges will pull up the whole screen after a time ,negative
The screen does not fit the front of the phone with the proper curve around the edge which makes it difficult to type sometimes around the edges because it is not touching the phone Very frustrating ,negative
Ive used Zagg for every smartphone Ive had and its saved me so much money in phone screens Warranty is true and easy to do Seems to crack fairly easily but it protects your screen regardless ,positive
This was recommended​by the Best Buy sales associate and she installed it while I waited It is much better than the plastic screen protector I was using Feels like there is nothing on the screen ,positive

I love the clean and clear look that this protection offers and totally recommend this product to all who want to keep their screens protected snd looking like new ,positive
Like so many others I can confirm the GLASS version of the screen protector does not fit correctly The edges never make a seal and are a point of failure in the design Do not buy ,negative
Screen protector easy to apply and fits perfectly On the bottom near the main phone button got caught on something and now there is a rough spot on the protector but it does not seem to be a problem ,negative
As all the other people have stated the product does not fit the phoneBest Buy should pull this product off of the shelf ,negative

Never had a screen protector that didnt fit snug all the way to the outer edge of the phone This one doesnt which isnt the worst thing in the worldhopefully it wont pose a problem ,negative
I was told that the glass option of the protector would be the better option It holds up well however you can see every scratch on it unlike my previous vinyl ones Plus it does fit well along the edges ,positive
This product is not good The S7yes not s7 edge curves slightly at the edges while this screen protector is flat which causes it to flare around the edges and not lay flat on screen Does not look good at all ,positive
After 2 months of using my new phone with this protector the shield has failed I dropped my phone and the screen shattered ,negative

I have a 2 year old son he has dropped my phone MANY times There are two or three tiny little scratches on the shield now No cracks no damage to the phone So not perfect but a pretty darn good product ,negative
Not made for the Samsung Galaxy 7 The phone screen is slightly curved and the glass sheild is not so it has a tendency to cracker Supposedly they are making one to fit the phone Until then we suffer ,negative

The Zagg glass shield for the Galaxy S7 is great It does have that halo effect around the edges because the glass is sightly curves on the s7 but its still does its job and looks prettty good ,positive
These screen protectors crack way too easily The halo around the edges are kind of annoying They do their job so your screen doesnt crack but really annoying to warranty them every month or so ,negative
I find this shield to work well on the Samsung Galaxy S7 phone It is light weight so doesnt add bulk unlike the thicker glass shield I used on my old iPhone It does exactly what it is supposed to do ,positive
There is a small frame around all edges that does not secure to the phone so its noticeable when phone is off Geek squad installed said its due to slight curve on edges of phone ,positive
Ive always used Zagg glass screen protectors and have always been happyuntil now The screen protectors dont completely lie down on the sides leaving a gap that gathers lint dust etc NOT HAPPY ,negative
I have always purchased Zagg screen protectors for my phones This one is by far the best I have ever owned Employees at Best Buy told me this one is the best and I agree It is so easy to keep clean ,positive

Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Bubbles and lifts around the sides my girlfriend and i both have the same Zagg InvisibleShield Glass with the same problems ,negative

I like the way this product protects the screen on my Android but I need to keep replacing it because cracks always develop I have lifetime warranty but must pay 7 for shipping each time ,negative
I have these installed on all of my phones and wont even use a new phone until it is added I can not say I drop my phone often but these definitely help protect the screen I recommend these to everyone ,positive

Protect your Samsung Galaxy S7 device with this InvisibleShield glass screen cover Featuring fortified tempered glass construction this cover defends against scratches to extend your screen ’ s life ,negative
My screen protector I had didnt cover the whole screen and made touching the edge very hard now I have this one that has the ever so slightly curve to match my phone and edge touching is how it should be ,negative
This is my second oneIt is protective but tends to take on cracks fairly easilyThe phone screen itself does not get damaged which is its purpose ,negative
Not exactly sure what the issue istwo attempts by sales person and mine still did not seal properly on edges and is already cracked on a corner without having been dropped or mishandled ,negative
This screen cover offers exactly whay I expect from Zagg a very clear durable screen protector at a reasonable price I was pleased to purchase it and the salesman was kind enough to apply it ,positive
There is no contest The Zagg glass screen protector is the best on the market I have had it on a couple of my phones now and hope they will always make them for whatever phone I get in the future ,positive

It cracked in two weeks of purchasing and I dont remember dropping it Best buy replaced it free of charge and Ive registered this second one and I feel safe having it Say no to cracked screens ,negative
I have bought 2 of these and they cracked within a day or two each time It says that it has a lifetime warranty and I registered When I tried to do a vlaim it says I am not recognized ,negative
Does not hug the slight curves at the edges of an s7 Would be better if it was sized smaller Since purchasing there are already cracks along the perimeter It does offer scratch protection ,positive
Doesnt fit the phone even though its for an S7 Zagg is supposedly making a Glass Contour but it isnt out yet Dont know why this one was ever made ,negative
On the edges of the glass they do not stick due to the phones screen being somewhat curved So after a couple days it gets dust and its not very attractive and rather annoying Just a heads up ,negative
I have purchased ZAGG previously and this one offers great protection for my S7 screen The instructions make it easy to apply the protector to your phone and you can barely notice it ,positive
1st one chipped in less than 24 hours Cost 599 for sh to replace Does not fit flush on my phone screen Best Buy cant help me even though I bought an 800 phone and all accessories there ,negative
I like the idea of protecting my screen which the product has done numerous times but I certainly hate paying 6 for shipping when I need a replacement protector But the product alone is awesome ,positive

It does a very good job I like the product It helps keep the screen from breaking which my daughter has done many time on her phone So I would recommend this product to anyone with a cell phone ,positive
The shield chipped within 24 hours and then the replacement has now chipped Zagg products are terrible but they unfortunately seem to be the only option…there is a reason they offer free replacements ,negative
I love the protection of the screen The only downside is that the thickness of the screen protector does not cover all of the screen and sometimes I have to hit a button a couple times to go through ,positive
We have used this excellent product before on our 2 old cell phones We really like this screen cover glad it was recommended to us 2 yrs ago by your Best Buy rep at our nearby store ,positive
I balked at the price of my invisishield however it did a great job at saving my screen from cracking I would rather pay the sh fee for a new screen saver than buy a whole new screen for my phone ,positive
I have bought these particular invisible shields for every phone I had This one isnt really good because the edge of the protector wont seal It leaves a shadow when you are looking at your phone ,negative
The first time I accidently set my phone face down on a hard surface the glass protector cracked Maybe it hit something just right I am about to use their lifetime warranty hopefully that goes well ,negative
Product is durable and keeps my phone secure from any damage Have used Zagg protective covers for years and always find the product reliable ,positive

ive used this brand before and have been impressed but this one doesnt adhere around the whole edge and has already started chipping from less than 3 drops otherwise its been good ,positive

We are so glad that we bought this product to protect our phone It is so easy to wipe off and come cleanProtects the face of your phoneCant go wrong on spending the money on this product ,positive
Even though this is the screen made to fit the Samsung S7 it does NOT fit correctly It will not seal correctly It just comes up around the edges Best Buy Geek Squad applied 3 of them ,positive
This is a bit hard to apply correctly but does a great job protecting the phone Lifetime replacement is wonderful We have already gotten one replaced since our ballistic case did not do its job ,positive
Well this is my third Zagg shield Each time I have to pay 8 to have it replaced Not made for Samsung 7 fit over the edges The screen slants and the shield doesnt fit ,negative

Boy do I wish I would of read the reviews before I bought this screen saverI edges dont fit the screen and I can see it being pulled off the screen and breaking not impressed at all ,negative
Looked OK for a bit but has chips on the edges in a few places this with a case and being put in a pocket in my purse BB applied it so not an error on my part for putting it on wrong ,negative
I found everything that i wss looking for The people were very help and pleasent to talked to The prices were right in line with other stores The store was very clean I will be back ,positive
Should have read reviews Does not sit flush on face due to bezel of phone case leads to the shield cracking at the inside corners around the camera lense as well as the home button ,positive
The Zagg screen protector is simply and added bonus and a smart necessity to owning a new and fairly highdollar S7 cell phone It make s me feel much better to have than not have it ,positive
Got a really good price at BB and the associate did a nice job installing it Zagg took a beating on a different phone but kept the phone like new The free replacement program worked well ,positive
This is the second screen protector from this company that i used and I swear a day after I bought my phone I hit it against something and the screen protector did its job I love this product ,positive
This is a must have for me Wish it covered the whole glass of the screen Weird air pockets showup after Best Buy Mobile rep installs them This time it took 6090 days to show the bubbles ,negative
Have these on all my mobile phones They work great Have saved my screen from breaks many times Have had the glass protectors replaced via warranty thru Zagg with zero issues many times ,negative
I have purchased this for multiple devices and those that have broken have been replaced with ease keeping the screen of the phone protected and safe from wear Definitely worth the money ,positive

Zagg InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 I have bought one of these for every smart phone that Ive had and never had a problem until now this doesnt fit like it should ,positive

I love Zagg they stick by their products and honor their agreements I love the fact that it has a lifetime warranty from this day forward I will only buy Zagg screen covers to protect my phone ,positive
Although I think Best Buy could come up with a better way for installation ie mobile should apply rather than Geek Squad this product is one of the best screen protectors available ,positive
This is my second purchase i had the first sheild for 1 year i treat my phone rough the sheild cracked but my phone was intact Had to to get the same protection ,negative
Zagg protectors are usually good but this one is not It ruins the touch of the phone so you have to bang on the keys and even then you may have to hit the keys around the edge more than once ,negative
This is a great protective device for my phone This will help to ensure that I will a good clear screen that will be protected from scratching and can be easily cleaned ,positive
I really like zagg but they dropped the ball on this one The screw protector doesnt cover the how screen For some reason on the edges it doesnt completely stick Kind of a waster of 40 dollara ,positive
Ive had many phones and always use a screen protector This is the first time its ever broken Within the first month of getting it So Im a bit disappointed to be honest Good luck ,negative
I bought this to protect my s7 While I think it did its job protecting my screen it seemed to happen quickly Im not sure it its ultra sensitive or I had something pushing against my screen ,positive
The glass screen protector already cracked and chips on the edges It did it with my last phone also It is however better than the old school ones that you needed to replace every month ,negative
The glass doesnt curve to the edges so you get cracks pretty easy The only saving grace is the free replacements The only thing is you still have to pay or shipping ,positive
Purchased a cheaper screen protector initially and was a waste of money This one has no bubbles is easy to clean and has a lifetime warranty Will not hesitate to purchase for future phones ,positive
AT first I was uneasy getting screen protector but once Best Buy put it on I was supper content So far I love this item no issues what so ever I highly recommend this product ,negative

This glass screen protector saved my screen on numerous occasionsOne bad thing though it didnt fit very well It didnt fit my dads either ,negative
Would you like to have a cell phone with a damaged screen thats permanent or know that a fix is available to prevent this in the first place Its a no brainer as to what you should do ,positive
The screen on the Galaxy 7 is pretty touch but the added protection is worth the small price The screen is easy to clean does not interfere with the touch screen capabilities of the phone ,positive
Easy to apply Edges dont stay down when cover is put on but once the cover is on you dont notice it once its on Works perfect dropped phone many times with no issues ,negative
Chipped the first day I got it then cracked and now has a huge crack all across the screen protector Went to look for a replacement on the site and the product page says nothat available ,negative
These are the best screen protectors in my opinion and the only ones I use the edges can get lifted sometimes if used with certain cases I never get a new phone without getting a Zagg ,positive
I have always used Zagg products but this one is just all wrong Leaves a halo around the edge of the screen since the screen is slightly curved and the glass is not ,negative

I have been overall pleased with this screen protector with one exception You have to press a little harder than you normally would with a pliable protector Other than thatits all good ,positive
Every cell computer tablet that requires some type of computer screen protector I highly recommend Zagg It gets cracked broken I pay a small fee and get it replaced SO worth it ,negative
I really like this cover It is very clear and smooth to the touch My only complaint is that you have to push a little harder on your screen I guess due to the thickness of the glass ,positive
It cracked in two places first week i had it but i would rather it crack than my screen to crack Even though it wasnt 30 days best buy made me go through the manufacturer to get a replacement ,negative
Just be aware that this Zagg product does not completely seal on the edges of the S7 due to the curvature of the phone Does allow some dust to find its way under the glass ,negative
Screen shields help keep expensive phone screens from getting scratched andor broken and in my case keep sweat from staining the original screen lol ,negative
Although a little pricey it is well worth it I cracked my last screen protector and gother a new one for the price of shipping Bought another one for my new phone Well worth the money ,positive
This screen protector seems to be working ok my main issue with it seems to easily separate from the phone around the edges Not sure the adhesive is the issue or something else ,negative
I would not recomended It leaves a halo affect on the edges of phone I was told this is normal Concerned with dirt specs getting in between film and phone where the halo is ,negative
My wife hates the bulky protectors and just can not use them in small purses This screen protection is exactly what she needed ,negative
Was recommended this product from associates Terrible product would never buy again Not worth the money Scratches easily I have used much cheaper products that have worked much better ,positive
With the ZAGG glass Ive always used the Zagg film protector before and loved it I was skeptical about the glass but it works great with no effect on the screen image and resolution ,positive
The screen protector does not lay flat on the screen as the screen is curved Ended up contacting Zagg and getting their curved version Zagg was very helpful and great services ,positive
This glass cover has not impacted performance Only wish it was curved at the edges to match the actual glass The new version comes curved ,negative
It definitely protects your screen Make sure you put it on a time with no interruptions The company does honor their product by sending a new one and then you must return the old one ,negative
Although the glass screen protector goes on great with no bubbles it seems to be very delicate Ionly had mine 12 days before a corner cracked somehow Big perk is the lifetime warranty ,positive
So far I havent been to impressed with this screen protector It bubbles on the side so it doesnt look very neat It has chipped already just from sitting down hard on hard surface ,negative
This Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector is super clear and fits perfectly In my case it is the extra protection I need and easily wipes clean with the provided cloth ,positive
Im not sure if the screen protector breaks easier then the phone screen But Ill take replacing the life time free replacement protector over paying 150 to replace the actual screen ,positive
I found it difficult to install correctly on my phone and I still have some bubbles places where it doesnt adhere completely Not much better than a standard screen protector IMO ,positive
Easy installation took minutes to complete great protection civers entire screen with holes for camera no problems reading my touch no issues at all I am very pleased with this product ,positive
Easy to attach The design of the phone makes it difficult to use on edges so I placed this to the inside edge as far as I could ,negative
Good quality but unfortunately once you apply it on the phone both sides will stick out a little I wish they designe it little curve on both sides so it would fit perfectly ,negative
Very impressed with the quality of this glass screen protector I love that it has a lifetime warranty If the phone drops the protector is supposed to crack instead of your screen ,positive
I upgraded from Samsung Galaxy 5 I find the battery power much better with this phone unless Im using media such as YouTube or listening to music I find the picture quality the same ,positive
I love that the screen protector is not attached to the case You dont even notice its on there Just be careful because if you do drop your phone you can crack the screen protector ,negative
Im disappointed that they would make it without even a slight curve to match the S7 not S7 Edge So when I put it on the edges didnt stay with the curvature of the screen ,negative
The screen protector is ok Easy to install yourself Its stick down almost automatically However the edges down not stick like the rest of the screen Being glass it does not bend ,positive
this product has already broke in the first week of having it I have not got it fixed yet because of time and will I have to pay an amount to fix it It is a crack on the screen ,negative

Zagg makes great screen protectors for the Samsung phone its scratch resistant strong and easy to clean I would buy this brand again ,positive
This is my second one both had the same problem Within just a few days i had chips on the outside edges Everything else works fine but for the price this should not be an issue ,negative
The lifetime warranty is amazing Yes Ive dropped my phone a few times and had to replace the screen saver For close to 5 they send me a new one everytime ,positive
No scratches or dings on my phone but the protected has lips on either side that wont stick down all the way so it gets dirty in between protector and phone Otherwise its pretty good ,negative
With an active lifestyle my phone sees extraordinary wear and tear This glass shield maintains a great display and keeps my phone looking and operating like new ,positive
It is very protective for your screen Best there is However the s7 has a small dip around outside of screen that the shield can not cover due to its rigidness It creates a halo effect ,negative

we had tried other brands and they came off after 2 days We purchased this ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 and its been working great ,positive
This protector is too large for the S7 It is not an edge but still has curved sides The protector does not mine cracked the first day I had it because the edges didnt curve down ,negative
a complete protection for your touchscreen The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because of the price and for some reason the edges do not seem to be completely sticking to the phone ,positive
I have already dropped my phone a couple of times and this has saved my screen from shattering This paired with the Otterbox case is almost a 100 full proof from ever damaging your phone ,negative
I am uncertain how this screen cover compares to a plastic one as I am easy on my phones However I can tell you that it doesnt affect the sensitivity of the screen and it is very clear ,positive

I only had it for about a week before it broke Dont remeber the glass being this fragile when I had it for my iPhone Save the money until it gets more durable ,negative
